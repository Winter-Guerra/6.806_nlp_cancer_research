1) Coffee and green tea consumption is associated with upper aerodigestive tract cancer in Japan.
ABSTRACT ["The impact of coffee and green tea consumption on upper aerodigestive tract (UADT) cancer risk has not been established. Evaluation of the possible anticarcinogenic properties of their ingredients is confounded by the potential increase in risk owing to the high temperatures at which these beverages are generally consumed. We conducted a case-control study to evaluate the association between coffee and tea consumption and the risk of UADT cancer. The study enrolled 961 patients with UADT cancer and 2,883 noncancer outpatients who visited Aichi Cancer Center between 2001 and 2005. Information on coffee and green tea consumption and other lifestyle factors was collected via a self-administered questionnaire. Consumption of three or more cups of coffee per day had a significant inverse association with UADT cancer [odds ratio (OR) 0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55-0.96]. In contrast, consumption of three or more cups of green tea per day had a significant positive association with UADT cancer (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.13-1.70). These associations were evident for head and neck cancer but not for esophageal cancer. The association of coffee consumption with head and neck cancer was observed only among never smokers and alcohol drinkers. Similarly, the association of green tea consumption was observed among never smokers and never alcohol drinkers. No change in these associations was seen on stratification by each confounding factors. These findings suggest that consumption of coffee might be associated with a decreased risk of UADT cancer, whereas that of green tea might be associated with an increased risk."]

2) Cancer prevention by green tea: evidence from epidemiologic studies.
ABSTRACT ["In contrast to the consistent results of an inhibitory effect of green tea extracts and tea polyphenols on the development and growth of carcinogen-induced tumors in experimental animal models, results from human studies are mixed. Both observational and intervention studies have provided evidence in support of a protective role of green tea intake in the development of oral-digestive tract cancer or an inhibitory role of oral supplementation of green tea extract on a precancerous lesion of oral cavity. Evidence in support of green tea intake against the development of liver cancer risk is limited and inconsistent. An inverse association between green tea intake and lung cancer risk has been observed among never smokers but not among smokers. Although observational studies do not support a beneficial role of tea intake against the development of prostate cancer, several phase 2 clinical trials have shown an inhibitory effect of green tea extract against the progression of prostate premalignant lesions to malignant tumors. Prospective epidemiologic studies so far have not provided evidence for a protective effect of green tea consumption on breast cancer development. Current data neither confirm nor refute a definitive cancer-preventive role of green tea intake. Large randomized intervention trials on the efficacy of green tea polyphenols or extracts are required before a recommendation for green tea consumption for cancer prevention should be made."]

3) Green tea catechins: Proposed mechanisms of action in breast cancer focusing on the interplay between survival and apoptosis.
ABSTRACT ["Recent data have shown strong chemopreventive and possibly cancer chemotherapeutic effects of green tea polyphenols against cancer. Despite advances in breast cancer treatment, mortality from breast cancer is still high. Undoubtedly novel treatment strategies are needed for chemoprevention of high risk women and for the treatment of receptor negative breast cancer. Green tea catechins have been shown to inhibit proliferation of breast cancer cells and to block carcinogenesis. This review attempts a critical presentation of the mechanisms of action of green tea catechins in breast cancer. Several mechanisms of action of green tea catechins in breast cancer have been proposed including modulation of extracellular signalling, induction of apoptosis through redox regulation, or through modulation of epigenetic alterations. A number of molecular targets of green tea catechins have been suggested i.e molecular chaperones, telomerase, apoptotic cascade. Although the molecular links among the proposed mechanisms of action of green tea catechins are often missing, it must be emphasized that all the proposed mechanisms indicate that green tea catechins inhibit growth and /or promote apoptosis. It would be interesting if future experimental trials could take into account that green tea catechins are multi-target agents and attempt to link every novel proposed target with the other already proposed targets of green tea catechins."]

4) Randomized clinical trial of brewed green and black tea in men with prostate cancer prior to prostatectomy.
ABSTRACT ["Preclinical and epidemiologic studies suggest chemopreventive effects of green tea (GT) and black tea (BT) in prostate cancer. In the current study we determined the effect of GT and BT consumption on biomarkers related to prostate cancer development and progression.", "In this exploratory, open label, phase II trial 113 men diagnosed with prostate cancer were randomized to consume six cups daily of brewed GT, BT or water (control) prior to radical prostatectomy (RP). The primary endpoint was prostate tumor markers of cancer development and progression determined by tissue immunostaining of proliferation (Ki67), apoptosis (Bcl-2, Bax, Tunel), inflammation (nuclear and cytoplasmic nuclear factor kappa B [NF\u03baB]) and oxidation (8-hydroxydeoxy-guanosine [8OHdG]). Secondary endpoints of urinary oxidation, tea polyphenol uptake in prostate tissue, and serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) were evaluated by high performance liquid chromatography and ELISA analysis.", "Ninety three patients completed the intervention. There was no significant difference in markers of proliferation, apoptosis and oxidation in RP tissue comparing GT and BT to water control. Nuclear staining of NF\u03baB was significantly decreased in RP tissue of men consuming GT (P = 0.013) but not BT (P = 0.931) compared to water control. Tea polyphenols were detected in prostate tissue from 32 of 34 men consuming GT but not in the other groups. Evidence of a systemic antioxidant effect was observed (reduced urinary 8OHdG) only with GT consumption (P = 0.03). GT, but not BT or water, also led to a small but statistically significant decrease in serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels (P = 0.04).", "Given the GT-induced changes in NF\u03baB and systemic oxidation, and uptake of GT polyphenols in prostate tissue, future longer-term studies are warranted to further examine the role of GT for prostate cancer prevention and treatment, and possibly for other prostate conditions such as prostatitis."]

5) Tea, coffee, and milk consumption and colorectal cancer risk.
ABSTRACT ["Data regarding the effects of tea, coffee, and milk on the risk of colorectal cancer are inconsistent. We investigated associations of tea, coffee, and milk consumption with colorectal cancer risk and attempted to determine if these exposures were differentially associated with the risks of proximal colon, distal colon, and rectal cancers.", "Data from 854 incident cases and 948 controls were analyzed in a case-control study of colorectal cancer in Western Australia during 2005-07. Multivariable logistic regression was used to analyze the associations of black tea (with and without milk), green tea, herbal tea, hot coffee, iced coffee, and milk with colorectal cancer.", "Consumption of 1 or more cups of herbal tea per week was associated with a significantly decreased risk of distal colon cancer (adjusted odds ratio, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.16-0.82; PTrend = 0.044), and consumption of 1 or more cups of iced coffee per week was associated with increased risk of rectal cancer (adjusted odds ratio, 1.52; 95% CI, 0.91-2.54; PTrend = 0.004). Neither herbal tea nor iced coffee was associated with the risk of proximal colon cancer. Hot coffee was associated with a possible increased risk of distal colon cancer. Black tea (with or without milk), green tea, decaffeinated coffee, and milk were not significantly associated with colorectal cancer risk.", "Consumption of herbal tea was associated with reduced risk of distal colon cancer, and consumption of iced coffee was associated with increased rectal cancer risk."]
RESULT Consumption of herbal tea was associated with reduced risk of distal colon cancer, and consumption of iced coffee was associated with increased rectal cancer risk.

6) Enhanced inhibition of prostate cancer xenograft tumor growth by combining quercetin and green tea.
ABSTRACT ["The chemopreventive activity of green tea (GT) is limited by the low bioavailability and extensive methylation of GT polyphenols (GTPs) in vivo. We determined whether a methylation inhibitor quercetin (Q) will enhance the chemoprevention of prostate cancer in vivo. Androgen-sensitive LAPC-4 prostate cancer cells were injected subcutaneously into severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice one week before the intervention. The concentration of GTPs in brewed tea administered as drinking water was 0.07% and Q was supplemented in diet at 0.2% or 0.4%. After 6-weeks of intervention tumor growth was inhibited by 3% (0.2% Q), 15% (0.4% Q), 21% (GT), 28% (GT+0.2% Q) and 45% (GT+0.4% Q) compared to control. The concentration of non-methylated GTPs was significantly increased in tumor tissue with GT+0.4% Q treatment compared to GT alone, and was associated with a decreased protein expression of catechol-O-methyltransferase and multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP)-1. The combination treatment was also associated with a significant increase in the inhibition of proliferation, androgen receptor and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling, and stimulation of apoptosis. The combined effect of GT+0.4% Q on tumor inhibition was further confirmed in another experiment where the intervention started prior to tumor inoculation. These results provide a novel regimen by combining GT and Q to improve chemoprevention in a non-toxic manner and warrant future studies in humans."]

7) Green tea consumption and breast cancer risk in Japanese women: a case-control study.
ABSTRACT ["Although many in vitro and animal studies have suggested a protective effect of green tea against breast cancer, only a few epidemiological studies have examined this association, and findings have been inconsistent. We examined the association between green tea consumption and breast cancer risk in consideration of the hormone receptor status of tumors and investigated whether the association was modified by dietary and genetic factors based on a hospital-based case-control study in Nagano, Japan. A total of 369 pairs completed a validated food frequency questionnaire and provided blood samples. Four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped: CYP19A1 (rs10046), COMT (rs4680), MTHFR C677T (rs1801133), and MTHFR A1298C (rs1801131). We found no inverse association between green tea consumption and breast cancer risk. Compared with women who drank less than 120\u00a0ml of green tea per day, the adjusted odds ratio for women who drank more than 600\u00a0ml was 1.27 (95% confidence interval = 0.75-2.14; P for trend = 0.20). We also found no inverse association for either tumor subtype. No substantial effect modification was observed for menopausal status, 4 SNPs, or dietary intake of folate or isoflavone. This study provides additional evidence that green tea consumption is not associated with a decreased risk."]

8) Green tea and the risk of gastric cancer: epidemiological evidence.
ABSTRACT ["Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the leading causes of cancer death in the world. Numerous efforts are being made to find chemoprotective agents able to reduce its risk. Amongst these, green tea has been reported to have a protective effect against stomach cancer. This article aims to critically evaluate all epidemiological studies reporting an association between green tea consumption and GC risk. MEDLINE, EBSCOHOST and Google Scholar were used to search for clinical trials of green tea and its correlation to stomach cancer. Studies include cohort and case-control studies. Outcome of interests are inverse association, no association, and positive association. Seventeen epidemiologic studies were reviewed. Eleven studies were conducted in Japan, five in China, and one with Japanese descendent in Hawaii. Ten case-control studies and seven cohort studies were included. The relative risks or odds ratio of GC for the highest level of green tea consumption was compared. Seven studies suggested no association, eight an inverse association, and one a positive association. One study had shown a significantly lowered GC risk when tea was served warm to cold. Another study also showed a significantly risk with lukewarm tea. All studies that analyzed men and women separately have suggested a reduced risk in women than in men, albeit no significant difference. This review demonstrates that there is insufficient information to support green tea consumption reduces the risk of GC. More studies on the subject matter are warranted."]

9) Novel mechanisms of anticancer activities of green tea component epigallocatechin- 3-gallate.
ABSTRACT ["After water, tea is the most widely consumed beverage. The major active constituents in green tea are catechins, of which epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is the most abundant and active compound. Animal experimental studies using EGCG alone or green tea catechins with EGCG being a major component have generated a mounting body of evidence suggesting that EGCG as a naturally occurring compound and commonly consumed beverage ingredient is a promising cancer preventive agent. However, the relationship between green tea consumption and reduced cancer risk seen from epidemiologic studies is not as encouraging as that observed in animal studies and remains inconclusive. In the present article, the achievements using EGCG or green tea catechins for cancer prevention were reviewed, the latest identified anticancer mechanisms of EGCG and the emerging mechanism-based cancer therapies of EGCG were outlined, and the potential reasons for the discrepancy in animal studies and epidemiological studies were tentatively analysed. On the basis of these analyses, it could be anticipated that future intervention trials in humans would be able to achieve consistent cancer prevention effects provided that the timely intervention of EGCG or green tea catechins at appropriate high-dose levels presumably approaching their upper safety limits have had been fully considered."]

10) Primary cancer prevention by green tea, and tertiary cancer prevention by the combination of green tea catechins and anticancer compounds.
ABSTRACT ["Green tea is a daily beverage, a non-oxidized non-fermented product containing at least four green tea catechins. Considering our first results when repeated applications of (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) prevented tumor promotion in mouse skin, we have continued to look at green tea as a possible cancer preventive agent. 1) The 10-year prospective cohort study by Drs. K. Nakachi and K. Imai revealed that drinking 10 Japanese-size cups (120 mL/cup) of green tea per day delayed cancer onset in humans by 7.3 years among females and by 3.2 years among males. The delay of cancer onset is of course significant evidence of primary cancer prevention in humans. 2) In collaboration with Dr. H. Moriwaki's group we successfully presented a prototype of tertiary cancer prevention showing that 10 Japanese-size cups of green tea daily, supplemented with tablets of green tea extract (G.T.E), reduced recurrence of colorectal adenomas in polypectomy patients by 51.6% (from 31% to 15%). 3) In 1999, we first reported that the combination of green tea catechins and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs showed synergistic anticancer effects in both in vitro and in vivo experiments, along with elucidation of the mechanism. 4) Further studies by other investigators have revealed that various combinations of EGCG or green tea extract and anticancer compounds inhibit tumor volume in xenograft mouse models implanted with various human cancer cell lines. Green tea is a cancer preventive, and green tea catechins act as synergists with anticancer compounds."]

11) Concentrated green tea extract induces severe acute hepatitis in a 63-year-old woman--a case report with pharmaceutical analysis.
ABSTRACT ["ETNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The popularity of concentrated green tea extracts as dietary supplements for a wide range of applications is increasing due to their health-promoting effects attributed to the high amounts of catechins they contain. The most important of the green tea catechins is (-)-epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate (EGCG). While their beneficiary effects have been studied extensively, a small number of adverse events have been reported in the medical literature. Here we present a typical reversible course of severe hepatitis after green tea consumption.", "The case study describes in a 63-year old woman during treatment with green tea-capsules upon recommendation of a cancer support group.", "The histological finding was consistent with drug induced hepatitis, and other possible causes of hepatitis were excluded. According to the CIOMS/RUCAM score the causality was assessed as \"probable\". After discontinuation of medication, followed by extracorporal albumin dialysis, rapid and sustained recovery occurred. Pharmaceutically analysis (HPLC) of the green tea capsules did not give evidence for contaminants but revealed the two typical compounds of green tea, namely (-)-epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate (EGCG, 93.2%) and epicatechin (EC, 6.8%) at a very high dose level.", "The present case highlights the fact that such concentrated herbal extracts from green tea may not be free of adverse effects under certain circumstances. There is still a lack of a uniform European Union-wide surveillance system for adverse drug reactions of herbal products. Therefore this case underlines the importance of public awareness in the potential risks in use of herbal products."]

ABSTRACT ["Green tea catechins, especially epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), have been associated with cancer prevention and treatment. This has resulted in an increased number of studies evaluating the effects derived from the use of this compound in combination with chemo/radiotherapy. This review aims at compiling latest literature on this subject.", "Keywords including EGCG, cancer, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and side effects, were searched using PubMed and ScienceDirect databases to identify, analyze, and summarize the research literature on this topic. Most of the studies on this subject up to date are preclinical. Relevance of the findings, impact factor, and date of publication were critical parameters for the studies to be included in the review.", "Additive and synergistic effects of EGCG when combined with conventional cancer therapies have been proposed, and its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities have been related to amelioration of cancer therapy side effects. However, antagonistic interactions with certain anticancer drugs might limit its clinical use.", "The use of EGCG could enhance the effect of conventional cancer therapies through additive or synergistic effects as well as through amelioration of deleterious side effects. Further research, especially at the clinical level, is needed to ascertain the potential role of EGCG as adjuvant in cancer therapy."]

13) Effect of green tea catechins on breast carcinogenesis: a systematic review of in-vitro and in-vivo experimental studies.
ABSTRACT ["Catechins (flavan-3-oils) are the main flavonoids present in green tea. The potential cancer chemopreventive and therapeutic properties of green tea catechins have been the focus of research efforts in the last two decades. This systematic review aims to generate in vitro and in vivo data on the effect of green tea catechins on breast carcinogenesis. Electronic databases were searched with the appropriate search terms. Existing evidence suggests that green tea catechins modulate breast cell carcinogenesis. The effect of green tea catechins on breast cell carcinogenesis has been investigated in different experimental models and under different experimental conditions, that is, carcinogen investigated, green tea catechin dosage regimen, treatment with green tea extract versus pure synthetic EGCG, and time point of treatment with green tea catechins in relation to the exposure to the carcinogen. Although the effect of green tea catechins was not always statistically significant, the protective effect of green tea catechins was demonstrated in all the trials, suggesting that treatment with green tea catechins should be further investigated in the clinical setting of chemoprevention of high-risk women. However, it should be emphasized that the reported actions of green tea catechins are observed in high concentrations that are difficult to achieve in the clinical setting. This drawback could be overcome by designing green tea catechins with better bioavailability and/or by cotreatment combining breast cancer endocrine treatment with green tea catechins."]

14) Transcriptomic analysis by RNA-seq reveals AP-1 pathway as key regulator that green tea may rely on to inhibit lung tumorigenesis.
ABSTRACT ["Green tea is a promising chemopreventive agent for lung cancer. Multiple signaling events have been reported, however, the relative importance of these mechanisms in mediating the chemopreventive function of green tea is unclear. In the present study, to examine the involvement of AP-1 in green tea polyphenols induced tumor inhibition, human NSCLC cell line H1299 and mouse SPON 10 cells were identified as AP-1 dependent, as these two lines exhibit high constitutive AP-1 activity, and when TAM67 expression was induced with doxycycline, cell growth was inhibited and correlated with suppressed AP-1 activity. RNA-seq was used to determine the global transcriptional effects of AP-1 inhibition and also uncover the possible involvement of AP-1 in tea polyphenols induced chemoprevention. TAM67 mediated changes in gene expression were identified, and within down-regulated genes, AP-1 was identified as a key transcription regulator. RNA-seq analysis revealed that Polyphenon E-treated cells shared 293 commonly down-regulated genes within TAM67 expressing H1299 cells, and by analysis of limited Chip-seq data, over 10% of the down-regulated genes contain a direct AP-1 binding site, indicating that Polyphenon E elicits chemopreventive activity by regulating AP-1 target genes. Conditional TAM67 expressing transgenic mice and NSCLC cell lines were used to further confirm that the chemopreventive activity of green tea is AP-1 dependent. Polyphenon E lost its chempreventive function both in vitro and in vivo when AP-1 was inhibited, indicating that AP-1 inhibition is a major pathway through which green tea exhibits chemopreventive effects."]

15) Green tea and lung cancer: a systematic review.
ABSTRACT ["Green tea is a beverage widely used by lung cancer patients and the public for its purported anticancer properties. The authors conducted a systematic review of green tea for the treatment and prevention of lung cancer.", "Six electronic databases were searched from inception until November 2011 for human interventional and preclinical evidence pertaining to the safety and efficacy of green tea for lung cancer.", "A total of 84 articles met inclusion criteria: two Phase I trials, three reports of one surrogate study, and 79 preclinical studies. There is a lack of controlled trials investigating green tea for lung cancer. Two Phase I studies showed no objective tumor responses at the maximum tolerated dose, ranging from 3 to 4.2 g/m(2) green tea extract (GTE) per day. Four cups of green tea daily decreased DNA damage (8OH-dG) in smokers. Human studies indicate that 800mg of green tea catechins daily does not alter activity of the CYP2D6, CYP1A2, CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 enzymes, however in vitro evidence suggests that green tea may bind to and reduce the effectiveness of bortezomib. Green tea applied topically may improve the healing time of radiation burns.", "Although some evidence suggests that chemopreventative benefits can be accrued from green tea, there is currently insufficient evidence to support green tea as a treatment or preventative agent for lung cancer. Green tea should not be used by patients on bortezomib therapy. Further research is warranted to explore this natural agent for lung cancer treatment and prevention."]

16) Green tea polyphenol epigallocatechin 3-gallate, contributes to the degradation of DNMT3A and HDAC3 in HCT 116 human colon cancer cells.
ABSTRACT ["Colon cancer is still the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. Epigenetic gene silencing involving DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) plays an important role in the progression of colon cancer.", "In the present study we found that the sensitivity of colon cancer cells to methylation plays a role in its response to alternative therapy involving the green tea polyphenol, epigallocatechin 3-gallate. HDAC and DNMT protein expression were reduced when methylation-sensitive HCT 116 human colon cancer cells was treated with EGCG, but was relatively stable in the HT-29 cell line. This decrease in expression may be partially explained by our finding that DNMT3A and HDAC3 are degraded in the methylation-sensitive colon cancer cells in part by inhibiting their association with the E3 ubiquitin ligase, UHRF1.", "These findings provide a rationale for the development of a targeted therapy for methylation-sensitive colon cancer that can include EGCG in combination with other DNMT and HDAC inhibitors."]

17) Green tea compounds in breast cancer prevention and treatment.
ABSTRACT ["Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women. In recent years, many in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that green tea possesses anti-cancer effects. The epidemiological studies, however, have produced inconclusive results in humans. Likewise, results from animal models about the preventive or therapeutic effects of green tea components are inconclusive. The mechanisms by which green tea intake may influence the risk of breast cancer in humans remain elusive mechanisms by which green tea intake may influence. Here, we review recent studies of green tea polyphenols and their applications in the prevention and treatment of breast cancer. Furthermore, we discuss the effect of green tea components on breast cancer by reviewing epidemiological studies, animal model studies and clinical trials. At last, we discuss the mechanisms by which green tea components suppress the development and recurrence of breast cancer. A better understanding of the mechanisms will improve the utilization of green tea in breast cancer prevention and therapy and pave the way to novel prevention and treatment strategies for breast cancer."]

ABSTRACT ["A two-stage, single-arm, phase II study was conducted to assess the effectiveness and safety of an epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG)-enriched tea drink, the double-brewed green tea (DBGT), as a maintenance treatment in women with advanced stage serous or endometrioid ovarian cancer (clinicaltrials.gov, NCT00721890).", "Eligible women had FIGO stage III-IV serous or endometrioid ovarian cancer. They had to undergo complete response after debulking surgery followed by 6 to 8 cycles of platinum/taxane chemotherapy at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Qu\u00e9bec. They all had to drink the DBGT, 500 mL daily until recurrence or during a follow-up of 18 months. The primary endpoint was the absence of recurrence at 18 months. Statistical analyses were done according to the principle of intention to treat. Using a two-stage design, the first stage consisted of 16 enrolled patients. At the end of the follow-up, if 7 or fewer patients were free of recurrence, the trial stopped. Otherwise, accrual would continue to a total of 46 patients.", "During the first stage of the study, only 5 of the 16 women remained free of recurrence 18 months after complete response.

20) Green tea phenolics inhibit butyrate-induced differentiation of colon cancer cells by interacting with monocarboxylate transporter 1.
ABSTRACT ["Diet has a significant impact on colorectal cancer and both dietary fiber and plant-derived compounds have been independently shown to be inversely related to colon cancer risk. Butyrate (NaB), one of the principal products of dietary fiber fermentation, induces differentiation of colon cancer cell lines by inhibiting histone deacetylases (HDACs). On the other hand, (-)-epicatechin (EC) and (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), two abundant phenolic compounds of green tea, have been shown to exhibit antitumoral properties. In this study we used colon cancer cell lines to study the cellular and molecular events that take place during co-treatment with NaB, EC and EGCG. We found that (i) polyphenols EC and EGCG fail to induce differentiation of colon adenocarcinoma cell lines; (ii) polyphenols EC and EGCG reduce NaB-induced differentiation; (iii) the effect of the polyphenols is specific for NaB, since differentiation induced by other agents, such as trichostatin A (TSA), was unaltered upon EC and EGCG treatment, and (iv) is independent of the HDAC inhibitory activity of NaB. Also, (v) polyphenols partially reduce cellular NaB; and (vi) on a molecular level, reduction of cellular NaB uptake by polyphenols is achieved by impairing the capacity of NaB to relocalize its own transporter (monocarboxylate transporter 1, MCT1) in the plasma membrane. Our findings suggest that beneficial effects of NaB on colorectal cancer may be reduced by green tea phenolic supplementation. This valuable information should be of assistance in choosing a rational design for more effective diet-driven therapeutic interventions in the prevention or treatment of colorectal cancer."]

21) Green tea consumption and risk of esophageal cancer: a meta-analysis of published epidemiological studies.
ABSTRACT ["We performed a meta-analysis to analyze the association of various levels of green tea consumption with risk of esophageal cancer. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library for studies of green tea consumption and esophageal cancer and identified 12 observational studies. For esophageal cancer, the pooled relative risk (RR) was 1.09 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.76-1.55] for greatest vs. non/least green tea consumption; however, there was significant heterogeneity across studies (P = 0.00, I(2) = 75.5%). Compared with subjects who drank no/least green tea, the pooled RR was 1.14 (95% CI = 0.97-1.35) for moderate drinkers, 0.94 (95% CI = 0.77-1.13) for those who drank little, and 0.97 (95% CI = 0.77-1.22) for all subjects who had ever drunk green tea. Subgroup analysis showed that the RR was 0.46 (95% CI = 0.29-0.73) for female subjects. The results of the present meta-analysis are that any association between green tea and risk of esophageal cancer remains unclear. Subgroup analyses indicated that greater consumption of green tea might reduce the risk of esophageal cancer in female subjects. However, the results are based on limited research. Further research is needed to confirm the results and clarify the likely biological mechanisms."]

22) Green tea polyphenol, (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate, induces toxicity in human skin cancer cells by targeting -catenin signaling.
ABSTRACT ["The green tea polyphenol, (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), has been shown to have anti-carcinogenic effects in several skin tumor models, and efforts are continued to investigate the molecular targets responsible for its cytotoxic effects to cancer cells. Our recent observation that \u03b2-catenin is upregulated in skin tumors suggested the possibility that the anti-skin carcinogenic effects of EGCG are mediated, at least in part, through its effects on \u03b2-catenin signaling. We have found that treatment of the A431 and SCC13 human skin cancer cell lines with EGCG resulted in reduced cell viability and increased cell death and that these cytotoxic effects were associated with inactivation of \u03b2-catenin signaling. Evidence of EGCG-induced inactivation of \u03b2-catenin included: (i) reduced accumulation of nuclear \u03b2-catenin; (ii) enhanced levels of casein kinase1\u03b1, reduced phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2, and increased phosphorylation of \u03b2-catenin on critical serine(45,33/37) residues; and (iii) reduced levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9, which are down-stream targets of \u03b2-catenin. Treatment of cells with prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) enhanced the accumulation of \u03b2-catenin and enhanced \u03b2-catenin signaling. Treatment with either EGCG or an EP2 antagonist (AH6809) reduced the PGE2-enhanced levels of cAMP, an upstream regulator of \u03b2-catenin. Inactivation of \u03b2-catenin by EGCG resulted in suppression of cell survival signaling proteins. siRNA knockdown of \u03b2-catenin in A431 and SCC13 cells reduced cell viability. Collectively, these data suggest that induction of cytotoxicity in skin cancer cells by EGCG is mediated by targeting of \u03b2-catenin signaling and that the \u03b2-catenin signaling is upregulated by inflammatory mediators."]

23) Tea consumption and lung cancer risk: a meta-analysis of case-control and cohort studies.
ABSTRACT ["Recent epidemiologic studies, especially cohort and case-control studies, have yielded inconsistent findings regarding the association between tea consumption and risk for lung cancer. The aim of this study was to assess a potential relationship between tea consumption and the incidence of lung cancer worldwide.", "A systematic literature search of PubMed, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, the Chinese Biomedical Database, and Wanfang Database was conducted from 1966 to January 2014 by two investigators. All cohort studies and case-control studies that evaluated the association of tea and lung cancer were included. Summary relative risks (RR) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random-effects model. Quality assessments were performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Q and I(2) tests, and the source of heterogeneity was detected by meta-regression analysis. Publication bias was evaluated with Egger's regression symmetry test. Subgroup analyses and sensitivity analysis were performed.", "Thirty-eight lung cancer studies (26 case-control studies and 12 cohort studies) with 59,041 cases and 396,664 controls were included. Overall tea consumption was significantly associated with decreased risk for lung cancer (RR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.70-0.87). Subgroup analyses showed that tea consumption was associated with reduced risk for lung cancer in women (RR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.62-0.93), case-control studies (RR 0.72; 95% CI 0.63-0.83), Western studies (RR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.75-0.97), and studies in China and Japan (RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.62-0.88). Both green tea (RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.62-0.91) and black tea (RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.71-0.94) were significantly associated with reduced lung cancer risk.

24) Challenging the effectiveness of green tea in primary and tertiary cancer prevention.
ABSTRACT ["Drinking green tea daily is part of Japanese culture, and various studies have revealed that green tea is a cancer preventive. We here review our progress in cancer prevention with green tea on 12 main topics, from basic to clinical level. TOPICS AND METHODS: Biochemical and biological studies of green tea catechins, a prospective cohort study, preclinical safety trials with tablets of green tea extract, double-blind randomized clinical phase II prevention trial for recurrence of colorectal adenomas, and synergistically enhanced inhibition by the combination of green tea catechins and anticancer drugs. All results were significant, including human studies with informed consent.", "Drinking 10 Japanese-size cups of green tea per day delayed the cancer onset of humans 7 years for females. For tertiary cancer prevention, consuming 10 cups of green tea per day fortified by green tea tablets, 50 %, significantly prevented the recurrence of colorectal adenomas. A minimum effective amount of green tea catechins for cancer prevention was found in humans. In addition, the combination of green tea catechins and anticancer drugs engendered a new cancer therapeutic strategy.", "The consumption of 10 Japanese-size cups of green tea per day is a significant factor in primary cancer prevention for the general population, and the preventive effect on recurrence of colorectal adenomas in patients is vital evidence in tertiary cancer prevention."]

ABSTRACT ["Green tea has shown the role of chemoprevention for cancer. Recently, several studies suggested that green tea intake may have effect on esophageal cancer risk, whereas the results were inconsistent.", "We performed a meta-analysis of all English and Chinese language studies of green tea consumption and esophageal cancer risk indexed in Medline, Embase, the Science Citation Index, the Chinese Biomedical Database and Wanfang Data from 1980 to June 2012. After reviewing each study, extracting data, and evaluating heterogeneity (Chi-square-based Q test and \u03992) and publication bias (Begg and Egger test), a meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the association between high/medium/low green tea consumption and non-drinking esophageal cancer risk. Pooled relative risk (RR) or odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using the fixed- or random-effect models.", "Ten eligible epidemiologic studies including 33731 participants and 3557 cases for esophageal cancer were included. Eight of which were case-control studies, and two were cohort studies. Overall, there were no association between high/medium/low green tea consumption and non-drinking risk of esophageal cancer (High: highest vs non-drinker: RR/OR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.49 to 1.02. Medium: drinker vs non-drinker: RR/OR = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.70 to 1.03. Low: lowest vs non-drinker: RR/OR = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.58 to 1.08). When stratified analyses according to study design (case-control and cohort studies), country (China and Japan), participates source (population-based and hospital-based case-control), and gender (female and male), there were significant association between high/medium/low green tea consumption and non-drinking risk of esophageal cancer among female (High: RR/OR = 0.32, 95% CI: 0.10 to 0.54.

26) Synergistic enhancement of anticancer effects on numerous human cancer cell lines treated with the combination of EGCG, other green tea catechins, and anticancer compounds.
ABSTRACT ["In 2008, we reported that 10 Japanese-size cups of green tea daily, supplemented with tablets of green tea extract (GTE), reduced the recurrence of colorectal adenoma by 51.6\u00a0% in patients after polypectomy. Based on these results, we paid special attention to Japanese cancer patients, who consume green tea every day and are administered anticancer drugs. This encouraged us to study whether the combination of green tea catechins and anticancer drugs has the potential to enhance the efficacy of the drugs.", "The combination of GTE and NSAIDs synergistically inhibited tumor development in rodents through the activation of the GADD153-DR5-TRAIL apoptotic pathway. Since then, this study was further extended by various investigators to the combinations of EGCG and other green tea catechins with anticancer compounds, the latter of which include NSAIDs, phytochemicals, and anticancer drugs. In order to demonstrate whether diversity of the combinations would generally induce synergistic anticancer effects on numerous human cancer cell lines, we studied the results of 42 in vitro combination experiments and the synergistic inhibition of tumor volume of 13 combination experiments using xenograft mouse models, which were previously reported by other investigators. The various combinations of EGCG and anticancer compounds induced similar synergistic anticancer effects for both in vitro and in vivo experiments, and showed an average reduction in tumor volume by 70.3\u00a0%. Considering the evidence showing that treatment with EGCG inhibited self-renewal of cancer stem cells, the combination shows a great advantage.", "Green tea is a cancer preventive for humans, showing a new trend of green tea catechins as synergists with anticancer compounds."]

ABSTRACT ["Tea is one of the most commonly consumed beverages worldwide. To date, observational data from prospective cohort studies investigating the relationship between green and black tea intake and prostate cancer risk are sparse and equivocal. In a population-based, prospective cohort study of Chinese men in Singapore, we investigated the relationship between green and black tea intake and prostate cancer risk.", "Tea consumption data for 27,293 men were collected at baseline (between 1993 and 1998) using a validated food frequency questionnaire. After an average of 11.2\u00a0years of follow-up, 298 men had developed prostate cancer. Proportional hazards regression methods were used to assess the associations between tea intake and prostate cancer risk.", "There was no association between daily green tea intake and prostate cancer risk, compared with no green tea intake [hazard ratio (HR)\u00a0=\u00a01.08; 95\u00a0% confidence interval (CI) 0.79, 1.47]. For black tea, a statistically significant positive association and trend were observed for daily intake compared with no black tea intake (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.41, 95\u00a0% CI 1.03, 1.92; p for trend <0.01)", "Few prospective data are available from populations that have both a high level and wide range of black and green tea intake; this study represents a unique opportunity to evaluate their individual effects on prostate cancer risk. Our findings support the notion that green tea intake does not protect against prostate cancer and that black tea intake may increase prostate cancer risk."]

ABSTRACT ["Green tea is a popular world-wide beverage with health benefits that include preventive effects on cancer as well as cardiovascular, liver and Alzheimer's diseases (AD). This study will examine the preventive effects on AD of a unique aroma of Japanese green tea. First, a transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) CL4176 expressing human \u03b2-amyloid peptide (A\u03b2) was used as a model of AD. A hexane extract of processed green tea was further fractionated into volatile and non-volatile fractions, named roasty aroma and green tea aroma fractions depending on their aroma, by microscale distillation. Both hexane extract and green tea aroma fraction were found to inhibit A\u03b2-induced paralysis, while only green tea aroma fraction extended lifespan in CL4176. We also found that green tea aroma fraction has antioxidant activity. This paper indicates that the green tea aroma fraction is an additional component for prevention of AD."]

30) Cancer chemoprevention with green tea catechins: from bench to bed.
ABSTRACT ["Many epidemiological studies and a large number of experimental studies using a variety of animal models have observed that consumption or administration of green tea appears to exert cancer chemopreventive activity. Based on the results of numerous laboratory cell culture investigations, several mechanisms have been hypothesized to underlie the anti-cancer activity of green tea catechins, especially that of (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the most abundant and active constituent in green tea. These mechanisms include promotion of anti-oxidant activity, inhibition of NF-\u03baB and AP-1, regulation of the cell cycle, inhibition of receptor tyrosine kinase pathways, control of epigenetic modifications, and modulation of the immune system. Several recent interventional studies examining the anti-carcinogenic properties of green tea catechins in humans have yielded promising results that suggest the possibility of their application to human clinical trials. This review article analyzes the results of these studies to explicate the effects of consumption or administration of green tea and its constituents on malignancies observed to date and discuss future directions in this research field."]

32) Green tea: a novel functional food for the oral health of older adults.
ABSTRACT ["Functional foods are foods with positive health effects that extend beyond their nutritional value. They affect the function of the body and help in the management of specific health conditions. Green tea, a time-honoured Chinese herb, might be regarded as a functional food because of its inherent anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial and antimutagenic properties. They are attributed to its reservoir of polyphenols, particularly the catechin, epigallocatechin-3-gallate. Owing to these beneficial actions, this traditional beverage was used in the management of chronic systemic diseases including cancer. Recently, it has been emphasized that the host immuno-inflammatory reactions destroy the oral tissues to a greater extent than the microbial activity alone. Green tea with its wide spectrum of activities could be a healthy alternative for controlling these damaging reactions seen in oral diseases, specifically, chronic periodontitis, dental caries and oral cancer, which are a common occurrence in the elderly population."]

34) Epigenetic effects of green tea polyphenols in cancer.
ABSTRACT ["Epigenetics describes heritable alterations of gene expression and chromatin organization without changes in DNA sequence. Both hypermethylation and hypomethylation of DNA can affect gene expression and the multistep process of carcinogenesis. Epigenetic changes are reversible and may be targeted by dietary interventions. Bioactive compounds from green tea (GT) such as (-)-epigallocatechin gallate have been shown to alter DNA methyltransferase activity in studies of esophageal, oral, skin, Tregs, lung, breast and prostate cancer cells, which may contribute to the chemopreventive effect of GT. Three out of four mouse model studies have confirmed the inhibitory effect of (-)-epigallocatechin gallate on DNA methylation. A human study demonstrated that decreased methylation of CDX2 and BMP-2 in gastric carcinoma was associated with higher GT consumption. It is the goal of this review to summarize our current knowledge of the potential of GT to alter epigenetic processes, which may be useful in chemoprevention."]

36) Does tea prevent cancer? Evidence from laboratory and human intervention studies.
ABSTRACT ["Tea (Camellia sinensis) is a widely consumed beverage and has been extensively studied for its cancer-preventive activity. Both the polyphenolic constituents as well as the caffeine in tea have been implicated as potential cancer-preventive compounds; the relative importance seems to depend on the cancer type. Green tea and the green tea catechin have been shown to inhibit tumorigenesis at a number of organ sites and to be effective when administered either during the initiation or postinitiation phases of carcinogenesis. Black tea, although not as well studied as green tea, has also shown cancer-preventive effects in laboratory models. A number of potential mechanisms have been proposed to account for the cancer-preventive effects of tea, including modulation of phase II metabolism, alterations in redox environment, inhibition of growth factor signaling, and others. In addition to the laboratory studies, there is a growing body of human intervention studies suggesting that tea can slow cancer progression and modify biomarkers relevant to carcinogenesis. Although available data are promising, many questions remain with regard to the dose-response relations of tea constituents in various models, the primary mechanisms of action, and the potential for combination chemoprevention strategies that involve tea as well as other dietary or pharmaceutical agents. The present review examines the available data from laboratory animal and human intervention studies on tea and cancer prevention. These data were evaluated, and areas for further research are identified."]

ABSTRACT ["Colorectal cancer is one of the leading causes of tumour-related deaths. In the present study, the chemopreventive effect of green tea on 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH)-induced colon carcinogenesis was studied in male Wistar rats. The DMH group received subcutaneous injections of DMH (30 mg kg(-1) body weight) once a week for 30 weeks, the normal group received the vehicle of DMH, and the DMH + green tea group received DMH simultaneously with 1% green tea as their sole source of drinking fluid throughout the experimental period. In the DMH group treated with green tea, significant reductions in gene overexpressions of colonic nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB), tumour necrosis factor \u03b1, inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase 2, and NF-\u03baB immunostaining indicates the anti-inflammatory effect of green tea in attenuating colon cancer. Moreover, the anti-angiogenic and anti-invasiveness effects of green tea were revealed as reductions of both vascular endothelial growth factor and matrix metalloproteinase-7 mRNA expression levels. These effects were confirmed by the significant reduction of serum tumour necrosis factor \u03b1, C-reactive protein levels, inhibition of tumour incidence, and nearly normal survival rate and colonic architecture. It can be concluded that green tea exerts a potent chemopreventive effect on colon carcinogenesis possibly due to the inhibition of NF-\u03baB."]

These antioxidant compounds have a potential for preventing and treating cancer, cardiovascular, inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases in humans. The aim of the present work was to design a new beverage with high antioxidant power combining extracts of green tea and apple, studying the antioxidant composition and activity, organoleptic properties (colour) and stability status during storage at different temperatures. The majority compounds identified in the beverage were flavan-3-ols, being the (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate which had the highest concentration. After storage, floridzine was the compound with lower decrease of concentration. The new designed beverage had a good colour, and high antioxidant activity and stability at room temperature, so that the beverage needs no refrigeration, showing potential for the development of new healthy functional beverages."]

40) Oxidative stress reduced by a green tea concentrate and Capsicum combination: synergistic effects.
ABSTRACT ["Reactive oxygen species that are produced by aerobic metabolism and signaling cascades have the potential to play important roles in maintaining homeostatic redox and cell proliferation. When the balance between the production and elimination of reactive oxygen species is perturbed toward production, the result is oxidative stress. High levels of oxidative stress are a general characteristic of cancer. The altered redox state within a tumor microenvironment confers a growth advantage through increased proliferation rates, evasion of apoptosis, and increased resistance to therapeutic compounds. We have tested a synergistic combination of green tea-Camellia sinensis-concentrate and powdered Capsicum powder (TeaFense\u2122/Capsol-T\u2122) as a dietary supplement to reduce oxidative stress as an approach to elimination of malignant cells. Here, we demonstrate that the green tea-powdered Capsicum mixture effectively reduces levels of oxidative stress in both cancer (HeLa) and noncancer (MCF-10A) cells as determined from measurements of levels of the oxidative stress indicator Nrf-2 by western blot analysis. Nrf-2 is a transcription factor that controls an antioxidant response element. Increased expression of Nrf-2 is linked to high levels of oxidative stress and vice versa. Based on levels of Nrf-2, the mixture of green tea concentrate plus powdered Capsicum reduced oxidative stress by more than 50% compared with 15% by the green tea concentrate alone."]

41) Green tea and anticancer perspectives: updates from last decade.
ABSTRACT ["Green tea is the most widely consumed beverage besides water and has attained significant attention owing to health benefits against array of maladies, e.g., obesity, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disorders, and cancer insurgence. The major bioactive molecules are epigallocatechin-3-gallate, epicatechin, epicatechin-3-gallate, epigallocatechin, etc. The anticarcinogenic and antimutagenic activities of green tea were highlighted some years ago. Several cohort studies and controlled randomized trials suggested the inverse association of green tea consumption and cancer prevalence. Cell culture and animal studies depicted the mechanisms of green tea to control cancer insurgence, i.e., induction of apoptosis to control cell growth arrest, altered expression of cell-cycle regulatory proteins, activation of killer caspases, and suppression of nuclear factor kappa-B activation. It acts as carcinoma blocker by modulating the signal transduction pathways involved in cell proliferation, transformation, inflammation, and metastasis. However, results generated from some research interventions conducted in different groups like smokers and nonsmokers, etc. contradicted with aforementioned anticancer perspectives. In this review paper, anticancer perspectives of green tea and its components have been described. Recent findings and literature have been surfed and arguments are presented to clarify the ambiguities regarding anticancer perspectives of green tea and its component especially against colon, skin, lung, prostate, and breast cancer. The heading of discussion and future trends is limelight of the manuscript. The compiled manuscript provides new avenues for researchers to be explored in relation to green tea and its bioactive components."]

42) Modulation of signaling pathways in prostate cancer by green tea polyphenols.
ABSTRACT ["Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common malignancy found in American men and the risk factors for PCa include age, family history, ethnicity, hormonal status, diet and lifestyle. For the successful development of cancer-preventive/therapeutic approaches, consumption of dietary agents capable of inhibiting or delaying the growth and proliferation of cancer cells without significantly affecting normal cells could be an effective strategy. Polyphenols derived from green tea, termed as green tea polyphenols (GTP) have received great attention in recent years for their beneficial effects, in particular, their significant involvement in cancer chemoprevention and chemotherapy. Several studies have reported beneficial effects of GTP using in vitro and in vivo approaches and in human clinical trials. Among green tea catechins, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is best studied for its cancer preventive properties. In this review article, we present available scientific literature about the effects of GTP and EGCG on signaling pathways in PCa."]

Based on evidence that colorectal adenomas and prostate cancer in humans have been prevented, we review here the concept that the combination of anticancer drugs with green tea catechin synergistically induces apoptosis of human cancer cells, inhibits tumor formation in mice, and enhances inhibition of tumor growth in xenograft mouse models. As a molecular mechanism by the combination, the induction of growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible 153 (GADD153, CHOP) gene expression is discussed in relation to death receptor 5 and TRAIL-apoptotic pathway. The combination of anticancer drugs with green tea could be a new cancer therapeutic strategy in humans."]

The aim was to produce an overview of the evidence for green tea for these three important health conditions.", "The databases Medline (& Medline in process) and Embase, were searched for systematic reviews and meta-analyses using customised search strategies performed up until April 2012. Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews criteria were used to assess the quality of the included reviews. Relevant data were extracted into predefined tables. The results are described and discussed narratively.", "We included eight systematic reviews and meta-analyses covering the topics of cancer risk (n=2), cardiovascular risk (n=4) and weight loss (n=2).", "The evidence for green tea and cancer risk is inadequate and inconclusive. However there is some positive evidence for risk reduction of breast, prostate, ovarian and endometrial cancers with green tea. RCTs of green tea and cardiovascular risk factors suggest that green tea may reduce low-density lipoproteins and total cholesterol, although studies are of short duration. There is no robust evidence to support a reduction in coronary artery disease risk in green tea drinkers.

ABSTRACT ["Numerous in vivo and in vitro studies point to the possibility of using green tea's catechins in chemoprevention of cancer. Recent studies show the inhibitory effects of epigallocatechin gallate on the growth of existing tumors including breast cancer, skin cancer and gastrointestinal tract cancers. Another mode of action of biologically active compounds in green tea involves inhibiting the neoplastic process. All these mechanisms may be useful in prevention and inhibition of the cancer processes (initiation, promotion and progress) by the consumption of green tea. However, clinical studies show contradictory results. Several independent factors, such as the temperature of the beverage, the duration of consumption, the amount of consumed tea and the diet used by the analyzed group, have a decisive effect on the final effect of plant polyphenols on the process of carcinogenesis. \u00a0"]

46) Effects of green tea, black tea, and coffee consumption on the risk of esophageal cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies.
ABSTRACT ["Epidemiological studies regarding the associations of tea and coffee consumption with esophageal cancer (EC) risk are still inconsistent and this meta-analysis was conducted to examine these associations. PubMed, ISI -Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Chinese VIP database up to October 2011 were searched and manual search for reference lists of relevant studies were conducted. Random effects model was used to pool the odds ratios (OR). Twenty-four case-control and cohort studies with 7376 EC cases were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled OR of EC was 0.77 [95% confidence intervals (95% CI): 0.57, 1.04] for highest vs. non/lowest green tea consumption; but it was statistically significant for case-control studies (OR = 0.70; 95% CI: 0.51, 0.96) and for studies conducted in China (OR = 0.64; 95% CI: 0.44, 0.95). No significant association was observed for the highest vs. non/lowest black tea consumption against EC risk (OR = 1.35; 95% CI: 0.86, 2.11). A borderline significantly inverse association of highest vs. non/lowest coffee consumption against EC risk was found (OR = 0.88; 95% CI: 0.76, 1.01). In conclusion, our data showed that both green tea and coffee consumption, but not black tea consumption, have protective effects on EC."]

47) Effect of green tea extract on reactive oxygen species produced by neutrophils from cancer patients.
ABSTRACT ["Oxidative stress in cancer patients has been demonstrated to be partly mediated by neutrophils. Although it is reported that natural antioxidants, such as green tea extract, reduce oxidative stress, there is limited evidence of their effects in cancer patients. This study aimed to determine the effect of green tea extract on reactive oxygen species produced by neutrophils from cancer patients.", "Peripheral blood samples were obtained from eighteen patients with advanced cancer. Green tea extract was added to the blood samples with luminol on Mebiol gel, and luminol-dependent chemiluminescence was measured to monitor the production of reactive oxygen species from migrated neutrophils into the gel, at 37\u00b0C.", "Luminol-dependent chemiluminescence was significantly down-regulated in the presence of green tea extract in a concentration-dependent manner.", "These results indicate the antioxidant effect of green tea extract on reactive oxygen species produced by neutrophils, which may be effective in reducing oxidative stress in cancer patients."]

48) Role of Bax/Bcl-2 family members in green tea polyphenol induced necroptosis of p53-deficient Hep3B cells.
ABSTRACT ["Green tea polyphenol (GTP) is one of the most promising chemopreventive agent for cancer; it can inhibit cancer cell proliferation and induce apoptosis through p53-dependent cell signaling pathways. Unfortunately, many tumor cells lack the functional p53, and little is known about the effect of GTP on the p53-deficient/mutant cancer cells. To understand the p53-independent mechanisms in GTP-treated p53-dificient/mutant cancer cells, we have now examined GTP-induced cytotoxicity in human hepatoma Hep3B cells (p53-deficient). The results showed that GTP could induce Bax and Bak activation, cytochrome c release, caspase activation, and necroptosis of Hep3B cells. Bax and Bak, two key molecules of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP), were interdependently activated by GTP, with translocation and homo-oligomerization on the mitochondria. Bax and Bak induce cytochrome c release. Importantly, cytochrome c release and necroptosis were diminished in Hep3B cells (Bax(-/-)) and Hep3B cells (Bak(-/-)). Furthermore, overexpression of Bcl-2 could ameliorate GTP-induced cytochrome c release and necroptosis. Together, the findings suggested that GTP-induced necroptosis was modulated by the p53-independent pathway, which was related to the translocation of Bax and Bak to mitochondria, release of cytochrome c, and activation of caspases."]

49) Green tea and incidence of colorectal cancer: evidence from prospective cohort studies.
ABSTRACT ["A systematic meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies on green tea consumption and colorectal cancer was performed to determine whether green tea has a chemopreventive effect against colorectal cancer. Six eligible cohort studies involving 352,275 participants and 1675 cases of colorectal cancer were identified. Combined relative risk (RR) ratios for the highest vs. lowest and increment of 1 cup/day green tea consumption levels were calculated. The combined RR of 0.90 (95% CI: 0.72-1.08) was found comparing highest vs. lowest green tea consumption levels for colorectal cancer. No significant differences by cancer-site were found, but an inverse association between green tea and incidence of colorectal cancer (RR: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.55-0.85) and colon cancer (RR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.48-0.98) was demonstrated in Shanghai population. Singapore men had a higher risk of colorectal cancer (RR: 1.36; 95% CI: 1.06-1.74). Furthermore, an increase in green tea consumption of 1 cup/day was not associated with incidence of colorectal cancer (RR: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.91-1.03). Despite the limited evidence from Shanghai studies in support of green tea as potential chemopreventive agents against colorectal cancer, available data from prospective cohort studies are insufficient to conclude that green tea may protect against colorectal cancer."]

50) Dose-dependent functionality and toxicity of green tea polyphenols in experimental rodents.
ABSTRACT ["A large number of physiologically functional foods are comprised of plant polyphenols. Their antioxidative activities have been intensively studied for a long period and proposed to be one of the major mechanisms of action accounting for their health promotional and disease preventive effects. Green tea polyphenols (GTPs) are considered to possess marked anti-oxidative properties and versatile beneficial functions, including anti-inflammation and cancer prevention. On the other hand, some investigators, including us, have uncovered their toxicity at high doses presumably due to pro-oxidative properties. For instance, both experimental animal studies and epidemiological surveys have demonstrated that GTPs may cause hepatotoxicity. We also recently showed that diets containing high doses (0.5-1%) of a GTP deteriorated dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced intestinal inflammation and carcinogenesis. In addition, colitis mode mice fed a 1% GTP exhibited symptoms of nephrotoxicity, as indicated by marked elevation of serum creatinine level. This diet also increased thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances, a reliable marker of oxidative damage, in both kidneys and livers even in normal mice, while the expression levels of antioxidant enzymes and heat shock proteins (HSPs) were diminished in colitis and normal mice. Intriguingly, GTPs at 0.01% and 0.1% showed hepato-protective activities, i.e., they significantly suppressed DSS-increased serum aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels. Moreover, those diets remarkably restored DSS-down-regulated expressions of heme oxygenase-1 and HSP70 in livers and kidneys. Taken together, while low and medium doses of GTPs are beneficial in colitis model mice, unwanted side-effects occasionally emerge with high doses. This dose-dependent functionality and toxicity of GTPs are in accordance with the concept of hormesis, in which mild, but not severe, stress activates defense systems for adaptation and survival."]

ABSTRACT ["We examined the association between green tea consumption and mortality due to all causes, cancer, heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, respiratory disease, injuries, and other causes of death in a large-scale population-based cohort study in Japan.", "We studied 90,914 Japanese (aged between 40 and 69\u00a0years) recruited between 1990 and 1994. After 18.7\u00a0years of follow-up, 12,874 deaths were reported. The association between green tea consumption and risk of all causes and major causes of mortality was assessed using the Cox proportional hazards regression model with adjustment for potential confounders.", "Hazard ratios for all-cause mortality among men who consumed green tea compared with those who drank less than 1 cup/day were 0.96 (0.89-1.03) for 1-2 cups/day, 0.88 (0.82-0.95) for 3-4 cups/day, and 0.87 (0.81-0.94) for more than 5 cups/day (P for trend <.001). Corresponding hazard ratios for women were 0.90 (0.81-1.00), 0.87 (0.79-0.96), and 0.83 (0.75-0.91; P for trend <.001). Green tea was inversely associated with mortality from heart disease in both men and women and mortality from cerebrovascular disease and respiratory disease in men. No association was found between green tea and total cancer mortality.", "This prospective study suggests that the consumption of green tea may reduce the risk of all-cause mortality and the three leading causes of death in Japan."]

52) Green tea consumption and gastric cancer risk: an evaluation based on a systematic review of epidemiologic evidence among the Japanese population.
ABSTRACT ["Numerous in vitro and animal studies have shown that green tea has a protective effect against cancer. However, results from epidemiologic studies are conflicting. We evaluated the association between green tea consumption and risk for gastric cancer risk among the Japanese population based on a systematic review of epidemiologic evidence.", "Original data were obtained from MEDLINE searches using PubMed or from searches of the Ichushi database, complemented with manual searches. Evaluation of associations was based on the strength of evidence and the magnitude of association, together with biologic plausibility.", "Eight cohort studies and three case-control studies were identified. Overall, we found no preventive effect on gastric cancer for green tea intake in cohort studies. However, a small, consistent risk reduction limited to women was observed, which was confirmed by pooling data of six cohort studies (hazard ratio = 0.79, 95% confidence interval 0.65-0.96 with \u22655 cups/day of green tea intake). Case-control studies consistently showed a weak inverse association between green tea intake and gastric cancer risk.", "We conclude that green tea possibly decreases the risk of gastric cancer in women.

ABSTRACT ["Observational and experimental data support a potential breast cancer chemopreventive effect of green tea.", "We conducted an ancillary study using archived blood/urine from a phase IB randomised, placebo-controlled dose escalation trial of an oral green tea extract, Polyphenon E (Poly E), in breast cancer patients. Using an adaptive trial design, women with stage I-III breast cancer who completed adjuvant treatment were randomised to Poly E 400\u00a0mg (n\u00a0=\u00a016), 600\u00a0mg (n\u00a0=\u00a011) and 800\u00a0mg (n\u00a0=\u00a03) twice daily or matching placebo (n\u00a0=\u00a010) for 6\u00a0months.

54) Identification of six new susceptibility loci for invasive epithelial ovarian cancer.
ABSTRACT ["Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 12 epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) susceptibility alleles. The pattern of association at these loci is consistent in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers who are at high risk of EOC. After imputation to 1000 Genomes Project data, we assessed associations of 11 million genetic variants with EOC risk from 15,437 cases unselected for family history and 30,845 controls and from 15,252 BRCA1 mutation carriers and 8,211 BRCA2 mutation carriers (3,096 with ovarian cancer), and we combined the results in a meta-analysis. This new study design yielded increased statistical power, leading to the discovery of six new EOC susceptibility loci. Variants at 1p36 (nearest gene, WNT4), 4q26 (SYNPO2), 9q34.2 (ABO) and 17q11.2 (ATAD5) were associated with EOC risk, and at 1p34.3 (RSPO1) and 6p22.1 (GPX6) variants were specifically associated with the serous EOC subtype, all with P < 5 \u00d7 10(-8). Incorporating these variants into risk assessment tools will improve clinical risk predictions for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers."]

We determined the serum and urine concentrations of phenolic acids, hippuric acid, and polyhydroxyphenyl-\u03b3-valerolactones during green tea (GT) and black tea (BT) administration. The effects of (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (3,4-DHPAA) alone and in combination on bioavailability, intracellular metabolism, and antiproliferative activity were determined in HCT-116 colon cancer cells.", "The concentration of phenolic metabolites was quantified by HPLC with electrochemical detection and MS. Urine concentrations of 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (4-HPAA), 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (3-HPAA), and polyhydroxy-\u03b3-valerolactones were increased significantly in men drinking GT compared to control. Urine concentration of 3-O-methylgallic acid (3OMGA) was significantly increased in men drinking BT compared to control. Serum 3,4-DHPAA was significantly increased after consumption of GT and BT and 4-HPAA after GT consumption. In vitro treatment of HCT-116 colon cancer cells with 3,4-DHPAA and EGCG exhibited an additive antiproliferative effect, while methylation of 3,4-DHPAA was significantly decreased. 3OMGA exhibited the strongest antiproliferative activity among the phenolic acids.", "The consumption of both, GT and BT, was associated with a significant increase in urinary and serum phenolic acids."]

58) Green tea polyphenols extend the lifespan of male drosophila melanogaster while impairing reproductive fitness.
ABSTRACT ["Green tea is a popular beverage believed to have many health benefits, including a reduction in the risks of heart disease and cancer. Rich in polyphenolic compounds known as catechins, green tea and its components have been shown to increase the lifespan of various animal models, including Drosophila melanogaster. Here, we investigated the gender-specific effects of green tea on the lifespan of fruit flies and observed that green tea extended the lifespan of male flies only. This effect was found to be independent of typical aging interventions, such as dietary restriction, modulation of oxidative energy metabolism, and improved tolerance to environmental stresses. The one exception was that green tea did protect male flies against iron toxicity. Since there is an inverse correlation between lifespan and reproduction, the impact of green tea on male reproductive fitness was also investigated. We found that green tea negatively impacted male fertility as shown by a reduced number of offspring produced and increased mating latency. We further identified that the lifespan extension properties of green tea was only observed in the presence of females which alludes to a reproductive (or mating) dependent mechanism. Our findings suggest that green tea extends the lifespan of male flies by inhibiting reproductive potential, possibly by limiting iron uptake. To our knowledge, our study is the first to report the negative impact of green tea on Drosophila male reproduction. Our results also support previous studies that suggest that green tea might have a negative effect on reproductive fitness in humans."]

We investigated the association of the combination of those consumption with stroke incidence in a general population.", "We studied 82 369 Japanese (aged 45-74 years; without cardiovascular disease [CVD] or cancer in 1995 and 1998 for Cohort I and II, respectively) who received 13 years of mean follow-up through the end of 2007. Green tea and coffee consumption was assessed by self-administered food frequency questionnaire at baseline.", "In the 1 066 718 person-years of follow-up, we documented the incidence of strokes (n=3425) and coronary heart disease (n=910). Compared with seldom drinking green tea, the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) of all strokes were 0.86 (0.78-0.95) and 0.80 (0.73-0.89) in green tea 2 to 3 and \u2265 4 cups/d, respectively. Higher green tea consumption was associated with inverse risks of CVD and strokes subtypes.

Coffee consumption was associated with an inverse risk of CVD and cerebral infarction. Higher green tea or coffee consumption reduced the risks of CVD and stroke subtypes (especially in intracerebral hemorrhage, P for interaction between green tea and coffee=0.04). None of the significant association was observed in coronary heart disease.", "Higher green tea and coffee consumption were inversely associated with risk of CVD and stroke in general population."]

61) Oral administration of naturally occurring chitosan-based nanoformulated green tea polyphenol EGCG effectively inhibits prostate cancer cell growth in a xenograft model.
ABSTRACT ["In preclinical animal models, several phytochemicals have shown excellent potential to be used as effective agents in preventing and treating many cancers. However, the limited bioavailability of active agents could be one reason for their restricted usefulness for human consumption. To overcome this limitation, we recently introduced the concept of nanochemoprevention by encapsulating useful bioactive food components for their slow and sustained release. Here, we report the synthesis, characterization and efficacy assessment of a nanotechnology-based oral formulation of chitosan nanoparticles encapsulating epigallocatechin-3-gallate (Chit-nanoEGCG) for the treatment of prostate cancer (PCa) in a preclinical setting. Chit-nanoEGCG with a size of <200nm diameter and encapsulating EGCG as determined by dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscope showed slow release of EGCG in simulated gastric juice acidic pH and faster release in simulated intestinal fluid. The antitumor efficacy of Chit-nanoEGCG was assessed in subcutaneously implanted 22R\u03bd1 tumor xenografts in athymic nude mice. Treatment with Chit-nanoEGCG resulted in significant inhibition of tumor growth and secreted prostate-specific antigen levels compared with EGCG and control groups. In tumor tissues of mice treated with Chit-nanoEGCG, compared with groups treated with EGCG and controls, there was significant (i) induction of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases cleavage, (ii) increase in the protein expression of Bax with concomitant decrease in Bcl-2, (iii) activation of caspases and (iv) reduction in Ki-67 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen. Through this study, we propose a novel preventive and therapeutic modality for PCa using EGCG that addresses issues related to bioavailability."]

62) Smoking, green tea consumption, genetic polymorphisms in the insulin-like growth factors and lung cancer risk.
ABSTRACT ["Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) are mediators of growth hormones; they have an influence on cell proliferation and differentiation. In addition, IGF-binding protein (IGFBP)-3 could suppress the mitogenic action of IGFs. Interestingly, tea polyphenols could substantially reduce IGF1 and increase IGFBP3. In this study, we evaluated the effects of smoking, green tea consumption, as well as IGF1, IGF2, and IGFBP3 polymorphisms, on lung cancer risk. Questionnaires were administered to obtain the subjects' characteristics, including smoking habits and green tea consumption from 170 primary lung cancer cases and 340 healthy controls. Genotypes for IGF1, IGF2, and IGFBP3 were identified by polymerase chain reaction. Lung cancer cases had a higher proportion of smoking, green tea consumption of less than one cup per day, exposure to cooking fumes, and family history of lung cancer than controls. After adjusting the confounding effect, an elevated risk was observed in smokers who never drank green tea, as compared to smokers who drank green tea more than one cup per day (odds ratio (OR) = 13.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.96-58.51). Interaction between smoking and green tea consumption on lung cancer risk was also observed. Among green tea drinkers who drank more than one cup per day, IGF1 (CA)(19)/(CA)(19) and (CA)(19)/X genotypes carriers had a significantly reduced risk of lung cancer (OR = 0.06, 95% CI = 0.01-0.44) compared with IGF1 X/X carriers. Smoking-induced pulmonary carcinogenesis could be modulated by green tea consumption and their growth factor environment."]

ABSTRACT ["Nutraceuticals with anti-neoplastic potential are suitable candidates for extending the range of therapeutic options for several types of cancers. One of these malignancies is oral cancer of the squamous cell carcinoma type, for which current treatment approaches have not succeeded in improving long-term clinical outcome. We recently reviewed the beneficial effects of curcumin for the treatment of oral cancer. In the current review, we focused on the beneficial effects of other two nutraceuticals, green tea extracts [especially (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG)] and resveratrol, in the treatment of oral cancer. In vivo and in vitro studies as well as clinical trials were reviewed, focusing on the beneficial effect of each of these plant-derived dietary agents, either alone or in combination with various pharmacological agents. We also presented the anti-cancer effects against cancer cells and against components of the tumor microenvironment. It emerged that the poor bioavailability of these nutraceuticals poses an obstacle to their exerting adequate anti-cancer potential. Ground-breaking studies employing new nanotechnology-based therapeutic approaches were presented."]

ABSTRACT ["Green tea (Camellia sinensis, CS), a kind of Chinese tea commonly consumed as a healthy beverage, has been demonstrated to have various biological activities, including antioxidation, antiobesity and anticancer. Our study aims to investigate the antitumor, antimetastasis and antiosteolytic effects of CS aqueous extract both in vitro and in vivo using metastasis-specific mouse mammary carcinoma 4T1 cells. Our results showed that treatment of 4T1 cells with CS aqueous extract resulted in significant inhibition of 4T1 cell proliferation. CS extract induced 4T1 apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner as assessed by annexin-V and propidium iodide staining and caspase-3 activity. Western blot analysis showed that CS increased the expression of Bax-to-Bcl-2 ratio and activated caspase-8 and caspase-3 to induce apoptosis. CS also inhibited 4T1 cell migration and invasion at 0.06-0.125 mg/ml. In addition, CS extract (0.6 g/kg, orally fed daily for 4 weeks) was effective in decreasing the tumor weight by 34.8% in female BALB/c mice against water treatment control (100%). Apart from the antitumor effect, CS extract significantly decreased lung and liver metastasis in BALB/c mice bearing 4T1 tumors by 54.5% and 72.6%, respectively. Furthermore, micro-computed tomography and in vitro osteoclast staining analysis suggested that CS extract was effective in bone protection against breast cancer-induced bone destruction. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that the CS aqueous extract, which closely mimics green tea beverage, has potent antitumor and antimetastasis effects in breast cancer and could protect the bone from breast cancer-induced bone destruction."]

65) Tumoricidal effects of a selenium (Se)-polysaccharide from Ziyang green tea on human osteosarcoma U-2 OS cells.
ABSTRACT ["Selenium(Se)-enriched green tea consumption in human diets is well-known to reduce the risk of a variety of diseases. Here, we isolated a Se-polysaccharide (Se-ZYTP) from Se-enriched Ziyang green tea and investigated its antitumor activity on human osteosarcoma U-2 OS cells in vitro and in vivo. Se-ZYTP contained 94.5% of carbohydrate and 2.1% of uronic acid, as well as 2.14 \u03bcg/g Se, revealing that Se-ZYTP was an acidic Se-conjugated polysaccharide. Monosaccharide composition analysis indicated that Se-ZYTP consisted of mannose, rhamnose and fucose in molar ratios of 2.4:1.5:1.2:0.2:0.1:0.3:0.3. In vitro, both MTT and LTH assays proved that Se-ZYTP (25, 50, 100 and 200 \u03bcg/ml) could significantly inhibit the proliferation of human osteosarcoma U-2 OS cells in a concentration-dependent fashion (P<0.05 or P<0.01). In U-2 OS cancer xenograft model in BALB/c athymic mice, Se-ZYTP oral administration at three doses of 100, 200 and 400mg/kg body weight (B.W.) daily for 28 days resulted in obvious tumor regression as compared to model control (P<0.05 or P<0.01). In addition, body weights of mice in control or Se-ZYTP treated groups did not differ significantly and no mice died during experiment, suggesting the safety of Se-ZYTP. Therefore, we postulate that Se-ZYTP might have cancer-preventive and cancer-therapeutic benefit for human osteosarcoma."]

CAM use has grown and become popular among patients. In dermatology, honey, green tea, and vitamin C have been used as topical treatments for a variety of diseases. We performed a systematic review to explore the cutaneous effects of each of these three products. Honey's unique antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties were shown to contribute to wound healing, especially in ulcers and burns. Green tea, among many health benefits, demonstrated protection from ultraviolet-induced events, such as photoimmunosuppression and skin cancer growth. Vitamin C, known for its antioxidant properties and key role in collagen production, has been shown to produce positive effects on skin hyperpigmentation and aging. Future large well-designed clinical trials are needed in order to further investigate the potential of these agents as dermatological therapies."]

67) Combination of selenium and green tea improves the efficacy of chemoprevention in a rat colorectal cancer model by modulating genetic and epigenetic biomarkers.
ABSTRACT ["Dietary supplementation of selenium and green tea holds promise in cancer prevention. In this study, we evaluated the efficacies of selenium and green tea administered individually and in combination against colorectal cancer in an azoxymethane (AOM)-induced rat colonic carcinogenesis model and determined the underlying mechanisms of the protection. Four-week old Sprague-Dawley male rats were fed with diets containing 0.5% green tea extract, 1 ppm selenium as selenium-enriched milk protein, or combination of 1 ppm selenium and 0.5% green tea extract. Animals received 2 AOM (15 mg/kg) treatments to induce colonic oncogenesis. Rats were killed 8 or 30 wk later after the last AOM to examine the effect of dietary intervention on aberrant crypt foci (ACF) formation or tumor development. On sacrifice, colons were examined for ACF and tumors, the mRNA levels of SFRP5 and Cyclin D1, and the proteins levels of \u00df-catenin, COX-2, Ki-67, DNMT1 and acetyl histone H3. The combination of selenium and green tea resulted in a significant additive inhibition of large ACF formation, this effect was greater than either selenium or green tea alone, P<0.01; the combination also had a significant additive inhibition effect on all tumor endpoints, the effect of the combination diet on tumor incidence, multiplicity and size was greater than selenium or green tea alone, P<0.01. Rats fed the combination diet showed marked reduction of DNMT1 expression and induction of histone H3 acetylation, which were accompanied by restoration of SFRP5 mRNA in normal-appearing colonic crypts. The combination diet also significantly reduced \u00df-catenin nuclear translocation, Cyclin D1 expression and cell proliferation. These data show, for the first time, that combination of selenium and green tea is more effective in suppressing colorectal oncogenesis than either agent alone. The preventive effect is associated with regulation of genetic and epigenetic biomarkers implicated in colonic carcinogenesis."]

68) Epigenetic induction of tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-3 by green tea polyphenols in breast cancer cells.
ABSTRACT ["Aberrant epigenetic silencing of the tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-3 (TIMP-3) gene that negatively regulates matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) activity has been implicated in the pathogenesis and metastasis of breast cancer. In the present study, we demonstrate that green tea polyphenols (GTP) and its major constituent, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) mediate epigenetic induction of TIMP-3 levels and play a key role in suppressing invasiveness and gelatinolytic activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in breast cancer cells. Treatment of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells with 20 \u00b5M EGCG and 10 \u00b5g/mL GTP for 72 h significantly induces TIMP-3 mRNA and protein levels. Interestingly, investigations into the molecular mechanism revealed that TIMP-3 repression in breast cancer cells is mediated by epigenetic silencing mechanism(s) involving increased activity of the enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) and class I histone deacetylases (HDACs), independent of promoter DNA hypermethylation. Treatment of breast cancer cells with GTP and EGCG significantly reduced EZH2 and class I HDAC protein levels. Furthermore, transcriptional activation of TIMP-3 was found to be associated with decreased EZH2 localization and H3K27 trimethylation enrichment at the TIMP-3 promoter with a concomitant increase in histone H3K9/18 acetylation. Our findings highlight TIMP-3 induction as a key epigenetic event modulated by GTPs in restoring the MMP:TIMP balance to delay breast cancer progression and invasion."]

69) Green tea intake is associated with urinary estrogen profiles in Japanese-American women.
ABSTRACT ["Intake of green tea may reduce the risk of breast cancer; polyphenols in this drink can influence enzymes that metabolize estrogens, known causal factors in breast cancer etiology.", "We examined the associations of green tea intake (<1 time/week, 1-6 times weekly, or 7+ times weekly) with urinary estrogens and estrogen metabolites (jointly EM) in a cross-sectional sample of healthy Japanese American women, including 119 premenopausal women in luteal phase and 72 postmenopausal women. We fit robust regression models to each log-transformed EM concentration (picomoles per mg creatinine), adjusting for age and study center. In premenopausal women, intake of green tea was associated with lower luteal total EM (P trend=0.01) and lower urinary 16-pathway EM (P trend=0.01). In postmenopausal women, urinary estrone and estradiol were approximately 20% and 40% lower (P trend=0.01 and 0.05, respectively) in women drinking green tea daily compared to those drinking<1 time/week. Adjustment for potential confounders (age at menarche, parity/age at first birth, body mass index, Asian birthplace, soy) did not change these associations.", "Findings suggest that intake of green tea may modify estrogen metabolism or conjugation and in this way may influence breast cancer risk."]

70) Green and black tea for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.
ABSTRACT ["There is increasing evidence that both green and black tea are beneficial for cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention.", "To determine the effects of green and black tea on the primary prevention of CVD.", "We searched the following databases on 12 October 2012 without language restrictions: CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (OVID), EMBASE (OVID) and Web of Science (Thomson Reuters). We also searched trial registers, screened reference lists and contacted authors for additional information where necessary.", "Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) lasting at least three months involving healthy adults or those at high risk of CVD. Trials investigated the intake of green tea, black tea or tea extracts. The comparison group was no intervention, placebo or minimal intervention. The outcomes of interest were CVD clinical events and major CVD risk factors. Any trials involving multifactorial lifestyle interventions or focusing on weight loss were excluded to avoid confounding.", "Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, abstracted data and assessed the risk of bias. Trials of green tea were analysed separately from trials of black tea.", "We identified 11 RCTs with a total of 821 participants, two trials awaiting classification and one ongoing trial. Seven trials examined a green tea intervention and four examined a black tea intervention. Dosage and form of both green and black tea differed between trials. The ongoing trial is examining the effects of green tea powder capsules.No studies reported cardiovascular events.Black tea was found to produce statistically significant reductions in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (mean difference (MD) -0.43 mmol/L, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.56 to -0.31) and blood pressure (systolic blood pressure (SBP): MD -1.85 mmHg, 95% CI -3.21 to -0.48. Diastolic blood pressure (DBP): MD -1.27 mmHg, 95% CI -3.06 to 0.53) over six months, stable to sensitivity analysis, but only a small number of trials contributed to each analysis and studies were at risk of bias.Green tea was also found to produce statistically significant reductions in total cholesterol (MD -0.62 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.77 to -0.46), LDL cholesterol (MD -0.64 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.77 to -0.52) and blood pressure (SBP: MD -3.18 mmHg, 95% CI -5.25 to -1.11; DBP: MD -3.42, 95% CI -4.54 to -2.30), but only a small number of studies contributed to each analysis, and results were not stable to sensitivity analysis. When both tea types were analysed together they showed favourable effects on LDL cholesterol (MD -0.48 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.61 to -0.35) and blood pressure (SBP: MD -2.25 mmHg, 95% CI -3.39 to -1.11; DBP: MD -2.81 mmHg, 95% CI -3.77 to -1.86). Adverse events were measured in five trials and included a diagnosis of prostate cancer, hospitalisation for influenza, appendicitis and retinal detachment but these are unlikely to be directly attributable to the intervention.", "There are very few long-term studies to date examining green or black tea for the primary prevention of CVD. The limited evidence suggests that tea has favourable effects on CVD risk factors, but due to the small number of trials contributing to each analysis the results should be treated with some caution and further high quality trials with longer-term follow-up are needed to confirm this."]

71) Green tea consumption and risk of pancreatic cancer: a meta-analysis.
ABSTRACT ["Emerging laboratory and animal studies indicate that green tea inhibits development and progression of pancreatic cancer, but evidence from epidemiologic studies appears inconsistent and inconclusive. A meta-analysis summarizing published case-control and cohort studies was performed to evaluate the association of green tea consumption with risk of pancreatic cancer. Pertinent studies were identified by a search of PubMed and EMBASE up to April 2014. A random-effects model was assigned to compute summary risk estimates. A total of three case-control studies and five prospective studies were included, comprising 2317 incident cases and 288209 subjects. Of them, three studies were from China and the reminders were conducted in Japan. Overall, neither high vs. low green consumption (odds ratio (OR) = 0.99, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.78-1.25), nor an increase in green tea consumption of two cups/day (OR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.85-1.06) was associated with risk of pancreatic cancer. The null association persisted when the analysis was stratified by sex or restricted to non-smokers. In the stratification by study location, the summary OR for the studies from China and for those from Japan was 0.77 (95% CI = 0.60-0.99) and 1.21 (95% CI = 0.94-1.54), respectively (P for differences = 0.04).

72) Interaction of green tea catechins with breast cancer endocrine treatment: a systematic review.
ABSTRACT ["Recent data have shown strong chemopreventive and possibly cancer chemotherapeutic effects of green tea polyphenols and EGCG against breast cancer. This systematic review aims to synthesize data on the possible interaction of green tea catechins with breast cancer endocrine treatment. Electronic databases were searched with the appropriate search terms. Experimental trials suggest a synergistic interaction of green tea catechins with tamoxifen or raloxifene in the treatment of estrogen receptor-positive and estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer through estrogen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms. No evidence of an interaction of green tea catechins with aromatase inhibitors or fulvestrant has been reported. As green tea catechins are natural compounds with a rather favorable safety profile, the strategy of co-administrating green tea catechins with tamoxifen seems to be a rational approach in chemoprevention, adjuvant and metastatic breast cancer treatment that needs further investigation."]

ABSTRACT ["Green tea is commonly used as a beverage worldwide, especially in China, Japan, Morocco, and Saudi Arabia. Green tea and its constituents have been considered very effective in the prevention and treatment of various diseases. It contains a variety of catechins, which show a pivotal role in the modulation of biological activities and also act as chemopreventive agents. Earlier studies have confirmed that green tea and its chief constituent epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) have a potential role in the management of cancer through the modulation of cell signaling pathways. In this review, we focused on the beneficial effects of green tea and its constituents in the cancer prevention and treatment and its impact on modulation of molecular pathways."]

75) Targeting DNA methylation with green tea catechins.
ABSTRACT ["Aberrant epigenetic alterations in the genome such as DNA methylation play a significant role in cancer development. Green tea catechins have been reported to modulate epigenetic processes. This review aims to synthesize evidence on the modulation of DNA methylation by green tea catechins. Green tea catechins have been reported to reverse DNA methylation of tumor suppressor genes and increase transcription of these genes. Green tea catechins and especially epigallocatechin gallate modulate DNA methylation by attenuating the effect of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1). However, the exact mechanism of DNMT1 inhibition is not delineated. Suggested mechanisms include direct enzymatic inhibition, indirect enzymatic inhibition, reduced DNMT1 expression and translation. The possible effect of green tea catechins on other pathways of DNA methylation, i.e. methyl-CpG binding domain proteins, has not been investigated. Furthermore, the link between redox properties and epigenetic modulation by green tea catechins has not been defined either. Since green tea catechins are natural compounds with a rather acceptable safety profile, further research on their action as inhibitors of DNA methylation seems worthwhile."]

76) Black tea, green tea and risk of breast cancer: an update.
ABSTRACT ["Previous meta-analysis indicated conflicting results in case-control versus cohort studies on the association of green tea with breast cancer risk, and conflicting results were also found in case-control versus cohort studies in another meta-analysis on the association of black tea with breast cancer risk. Many studies were published after the previous meta-analysis. Besides, the dose-response relationship of tea consumption with breast cancer risk is unclear. Thus the association of tea consumption with breast cancer risk was assessed incorporating new publications. Summary relative risk (RR) for highest versus lowest level of tea consumption was calculated based on fixed or random effect models. Dose-response relationship was assessed by restricted cubic spline model and multivariate random-effect meta-regression. The combined results from 9 studies suggested no significant association between green tea consumption and breast cancer risk (RR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.64-1.04). No significant association was found among cohort studies and case-control studies after sensitivity analysis, respectively. A linear but not significant dose-response association was found between green tea consumption and breast cancer risk. The combined results from 25 studies demonstrated no significant association between black tea consumption and breast cancer risk (RR = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.93-1.03), and no significant association was found in subgroup analysis. A linear but not significant dose-response association was found between black tea consumption and breast cancer risk. Based on the current evidence, black tea and green tea might not contribute significantly to breast cancer risk, respectively."]

77) Green tea consumption and colorectal cancer risk: a report from the Shanghai Men's Health Study.
ABSTRACT ["Tea and its constituents have demonstrated anticarcinogenic activity in both in vitro and in vivo animal studies. Results from epidemiologic studies, however, have been inconsistent. Some factors that coexist with tea consumption, such as cigarette smoking, may confound or modify the association between tea consumption and cancer risk. The objective of this study was to comprehensively evaluate the association between green tea consumption and colorectal cancer risk in a population-based prospective cohort study, the Shanghai Men's Health Study. The analysis included 60,567 Chinese men aged 40-74 years at baseline. During \u223c5 years of follow-up, 243 incident cases of colorectal cancer were identified. Multivariable Cox regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of developing colorectal cancer. Regular green tea consumption (ever drank green tea at least three times per week for more than six consecutive months) was associated with reduced risk of colorectal cancer in non-smokers (multivariable-adjusted HR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.34-0.86). The risk decreased as the amount of green tea consumption increased (P(trend) = 0.01). Each 2 g increment of intake of dry green tea leaves per day (approximately equivalent to the amount of tea in a tea bag) was associated with a 12% reduction in risk (HR = 0.88, 95% CI: 0.78-0.99). No significant association was found among smokers (HR = 0.94, 95% CI: 0.66-1.34). This study suggests that regular consumption of green tea may reduce colorectal cancer risk among non-smokers."]

78) Sensitization to docetaxel in prostate cancer cells by green tea and quercetin.
ABSTRACT ["Chemotherapy with docetaxel (Doc) is a standard treatment for metastatic and castration-resistant prostate cancer. However, chemoresistance and side effects of Doc limit its clinical success. We investigated whether natural products green tea (GT) and quercetin (Q), a flavonoid from apples and onions, will enhance the efficacy of Doc in androgen-independent (AI) prostate cancer cells. Two cell lines including LAPC-4-AI and PC-3 were treated in vitro with 40 \u03bcM of (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), 5 \u03bcM of Q, 2 or 5 nM of Doc alone or in combination. The mixture of EGCG+Q+Doc increased the antiproliferative effect by threefold in LAPC-4-AI cells and eightfold in PC-3 cells compared to Doc alone. EGCG, Q and Doc in combination significantly enhanced cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase and increased apoptosis in both LAPC-4-AI and PC-3 cells compared to Doc alone. The mixture increased the inhibition of PI3K/Akt and the signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat) 3 signaling pathways compared to Doc alone, and decreased the protein expression of multidrug resistance-related protein. In addition, the combination with EGCG and Q increased the inhibition of tumor cell invasion and colony formation in both LAPC-4-AI and PC-3 cells compared to Doc alone, and decreased the percentage of CD44(+)/CD24(-) stem-like LAPC-4-AI cells. In summary, GT and Q enhanced the therapeutic effect of Doc in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells through multiple mechanisms including the down-regulation of chemoresistance-related proteins. This study provides a novel therapeutic modality to enhance the efficacy of Doc in a nontoxic manner."]

ABSTRACT ["Regular green tea intake has been associated with an inverse risk of breast cancer. There are compelling experimental evidence that green tea, particularly, epigallocatechin gallate, the most potent green tea catechin, possesses a range of anti-cancer properties. We conducted a pre-surgical study of green tea capsules vs. no-green tea in women with primary breast cancer to determine the effects of green tea supplementation on markers of biological response. Postmenopausal women with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or stage I or II breast cancer took green tea capsules (940\u2009mg per day) for an average of 35\u2009days prior to surgery (n\u2009=\u200913) or received no green tea (n\u2009=\u200918). Paired diagnostic core biopsy and surgical specimen samples were analyzed for cell proliferation (Ki-67), apoptosis (caspase-3), and angiogenesis (CD34) separately in benign and malignant cell components. There were no significant changes in caspase-3 and CD34 in the green tea and no green tea groups and there were no significant differences in the change in these markers between the two groups. However, Ki-67 levels declined in both benign and malignant cell components in the green tea group; the decline in Ki-67 positivity in malignant cells was not statistically significant (P\u2009=\u20090.10) but was statistically significant in benign cells (P\u2009=\u20090.007). Ki-67 levels in benign and malignant cells did not change significantly in the no green tea group. There was a statistically significant difference in the change in Ki-67 in benign cells (P\u2009=\u20090.033) between the green tea and the no green tea groups. The trend of a consistent reduction in Ki-67 in both benign and malignant cells in the green tea group warrants further investigations in a larger study of breast cancer patients or high-risk women."]

81) New insights into the mechanisms of green tea catechins in the chemoprevention of prostate cancer.
ABSTRACT ["Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and second most common cause of cancer deaths in American men. Its long latency, slow progression, and high incidence rate make prostate cancer ideal for targeted chemopreventative therapies. Therefore, chemoprevention studies and clinical trials are essential for reducing the burden of prostate cancer on society. Epidemiological studies suggest that tea consumption has protective effects against a variety of human cancers, including that of the prostate. Laboratory and clinical studies have demonstrated that green tea components, specifically the green tea catechin (GTC) epigallocatechin gallate, can induce apoptosis, suppress progression, and inhibit invasion and metastasis of prostate cancer. Multiple mechanisms are involved in the chemoprevention of prostate cancer with GTCs; understanding and refining models of fundamental molecular pathways by which GTCs modulate prostate carcinogenesis is essential to apply the utilization of green tea for the chemoprevention of prostate cancer in clinical settings. The objective of this article is to review and summarize the most current literature focusing on the major mechanisms of GTC chemopreventative action on prostate cancer from laboratory, in vitro, and in vivo studies, and clinical chemoprevention trials."]

82) Attenuated migration by green tea extract (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG): involvement of 67 kDa laminin receptor internalization in macrophagic cells.
ABSTRACT ["Excessive activation of the microglia in the brain is involved in the development of several neurodegenerative diseases. Previous studies have indicated that (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a major active constituent of green tea, exhibits potent suppressive effects on the activation of microglia. As the 67 kDa laminin receptor (67LR) is a key element in cellular activation and migration, we investigated the effect of EGCG on cell migration and 67LR in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated macrophagic RAW264.7 cells. The presence of EGCG (1-25 \u03bcM) markedly attenuated LPS-induced cell migration in a dose-dependent manner. However, the total amount of 67LR protein in the RAW264.7 cells was unaffected by EGCG, as revealed by Western blot analysis. In addition, confocal immunofluorescence microscopy indicated that EGCG caused a marked membrane translocation of 67LR from the membrane surface towards the cytoplasm. Cell-surface biotinylation analysis confirmed that EGCG induced a significant internalization of 67LR by 24-68% in a dose-dependent manner. This study helps to explain the pharmacological action of EGCG on 67LR, suggesting its potential use in the treatment of diseases associated with macrophage/microglia activation, such as neurodegenerative diseases and cancer."]

83) Epigallocatechin Gallate (EGCG) is the most effective cancer chemopreventive polyphenol in green tea.
ABSTRACT ["Green tea is a popular drink consumed daily by millions of people around the world. Previous studies have shown that some polyphenol compounds from green tea possess anticancer activities. However, systemic evaluation was limited. In this study, we determined the cancer chemopreventive potentials of 10 representative polyphenols (caffeic acid, CA; gallic acid, GA; catechin, C; epicatechin, EC; gallocatechin, GC; catechin gallate, CG; gallocatechin gallate, GCG; epicatechin gallate, ECG; epigallocatechin, EGC; and epigallocatechin gallate, EGCG), and explored their structure-activity relationship. The effect of the 10 polyphenol compounds on the proliferation of HCT-116 and SW-480 human colorectal cancer cells was evaluated using an MTS assay. Cell cycle distribution and apoptotic effects were analyzed by flow cytometry after staining with propidium iodide (PI)/RNase or annexin V/PI. Among the 10 polyphenols, EGCG showed the most potent antiproliferative effects, and significantly induced cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase and cell apoptosis. When the relationship between chemical structure and anticancer activity was examined, C and EC did not show antiproliferative effects, and GA showed some antiproliferative effects. When C and EC esterified with GA to produce CG and ECG, the antiproliferative effects were increased significantly. A similar relationship was found between EGC and EGCG. The gallic acid group significantly enhanced catechin's anticancer potential. This property could be utilized in future semi-synthesis of flavonoid derivatives to develop novel anticancer agents."]

84) Potential role of green tea catechins in various disease therapies: progress and promise.
ABSTRACT ["Green tea (from the plant Camellia sinensis), a beverage whose consumption started 5000\u00a0years ago in China, has important biological and pharmacological properties. The beneficial effects of green tea have been attributed to the presence of phenolic compounds that are powerful anti-oxidants and free iron scavengers. Of all the catechins found in green tea, namely (-)-epicatechin-3-gallate, (-)-epigallocatechin, (-)-epicatechin and (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), EGCG is the most abundant and powerful. It is widely believed that green tea may protect against death from all causes, especially cardiovascular diseases (coronary heart disease and stroke) owing to the presence of catechins associated with green tea consumption. Other health benefits include various types of cancer chemoprevention, weight loss and protective effects against neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease). Thus far, numerous pharmacological activities regulating disease-specific molecular targets have been reported in vitro for EGCG concentrations in the micromolar range, which are physiologically irrelevant. Although most of the studies have shown benefits with two to three cups of green tea per day, the optimal dose has not yet been established to enable any solid conclusions to be drawn regarding the various health benefits of green tea or its constituents in humans. With Phase I trials providing information on the safety profile and pharmacokinetics of EGCG, the window of opportunity is wider to undertake well-controlled long-term human studies to enable a full understanding of the protective effects of green tea catechins on various parameters in different settings."]

85) Green tea catechins: a fresh flavor to anticancer therapy.
ABSTRACT ["Green tea catechins have been extensively studied for their cancer preventive effects. Accumulating evidence has shown that green tea catechins, like (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate, have strong anti-oxidant activity and affect several signal transduction pathways relevant to cancer development. Here, we review the biological properties of green tea catechins and the molecular mechanisms of their anticancer effects, including the suppression of cancer cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis, and inhibition of tumor metastasis and angiogenesis. We summarize the efficacy of a single catechin and the synergetic effects of multiple catechins. We also discuss the enhanced anticancer effects of green tea catechins when they are combined with anticancer drugs. The information present in this review might promote the development of strategy for the co-administration of green tea catechins with other anticancer drugs to increase the potency of currently available anticancer medicine. This new strategy should in turn lower the cytotoxicity and cost of anticancer treatment."]

86) Green tea: a promising natural product in oral health.
ABSTRACT ["Green tea is a leading beverage in the Far East for thousands of years; it is regarded for a long time as a health product. Green tea is important source of polyphenol antioxidants. Polyphenols including epigallocatechin 3 gallate (EGCG) constitute the most interesting components in green tea leaves. Green tea has the potential to protect against various malignant, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. There is a growing body of evidence pointing a beneficial role of green tea and its polyphenols in oral health. Green tea protects against bacterial induced dental caries. Tea polyphenols possess antiviral properties, believed to help in protection from influenza virus. Additionally, green tea polyphenols can abolish halitosis through modification of odorant sulphur components. Oral cavity oxidative stress and inflammation, consequent to cigarette smoking and cigarettes' deleterious compounds nicotine and acrolein, may be reduced in the presence of green tea polyphenols. Generally, green tea defends healthy cells from malignant transformation and locally has the ability to induce apoptosis in oral cancer cells. All together, there is an increasing interest in the health benefits of green tea in the field of oral health. Nonetheless, there is still a need for more clinical and biological studies to support guidelines for green tea intake as part of prevention and treatment of specific oral pathologies."]

88) Human exposure asseessment to different arsenic species in tea.
ABSTRACT ["Inorganic forms of arsenic are much more highly toxic to humans than organic species. Their effects include being carcinogenic, genotoxic and neurotoxic, where in the latter case, above all, they affect nervous system development in the foetus, infants and children. The main foodstuffs contributing significantly to its total dietary intake are drinking water, rice (and its products), fish, seafood, cereals, seaweed, root vegetables, food supplements, mushrooms and tea. After water, tea is the second most popular beverage drunk in Poland with average consumption annually indicating that statistically every Polish inhabitant drinks at least one cup of tea daily.", "The aim of the study was to determine the total and inorganic content of arsenic in various black and green teas available on the market and thus to estimate consumer exposure to inorganic arsenic from this foodstuff.", "Analyses of total and inorganic arsenic were performed on 23 samples of black and green teas that consisted of tea leaves, teas in bags and granules, from various sources. The analytical method was hydride generation atomic absorption spectrometry (HGAAS), after dry ashing of samples and reduction of arsenic to arsenic hydride using sodium borohydride. In order to isolate only the inorganic forms of arsenic prior to mineralisation, samples were subjected to concentrated HCl hydrolysis, followed by reduction with hydrobromic acid and hydrazine sulphate after which triple chloroform extractions and triple 1M HCl re-extractions were performed. Exposure of adults was estimated in relation to the Benchmark Dose Lower Confidence Limit (BMDL05) as set by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) that resulted in a 0.5% increase in lung cancer (3.0 \u03bcg/kg body weight (b.w.) per day).", "Green teas were found to be more highly contaminated with both total and inorganic arsenic than black teas. Contamination of black teas total and inorganic arsenic was mean: 0.058 mg/kg (median: 0.042 mg/kg, 90th percentile: 0.114 mg/kg), and 0.030 mg/kg, (median: 0.025 mg/kg, 90th percentile: 0.030 mg/kg) respectively. Whilst for the green teas, these were correspondingly mean total arsenic content: 0.134 mg/kg (median: 0.114 mg/kg, 90th percentile: 0.234 mg/kg) and inorganic arsenic, mean: 0.100 mg/kg (median: 0.098 mg/kg, 90th percentile: 0.150 mg/kg). The estimated average adult exposures to inorganic arsenic in black and green tea were less than 1% of the BMDL05. Green tea samples, with the highest measured inorganic arsenic, were found to cause an intake exceeding 0.5% of the BMDL05 value. However when the drinking water is also accounted for when teas are prepared, then the exposure from black and green tea becomes exceeding 0.7% and 1.3% of the BMDL05 value respectively.", "Findings thus demonstrate that drinking black or green teas does not pose a significant health threat to consumers, even though contaminations in some individual samples were significant.", "total arsenic, inorganic arsenic, tea consumption, exposure assessment."]
RESULT Findings thus demonstrate that drinking black or green teas does not pose a significant health threat to consumers, even though contaminations in some individual samples were significant.

89) Chemoprevention of oral cancer: Green tea experience.
ABSTRACT ["Oral cancer has a well characterized progression from premalignant oral epithelial changes to invasive cancer, making oral squamous cell carcinoma an optimal disease for chemoprevention interventions prior to malignant transformation. The primary goal of chemoprevention here is to reverse, suppress, or inhibit the progression of premalignant lesions to cancer. Due to the extended duration of oral pathogenesis, its chemoprevention using natural products has been found promising due to their decreased dose and limited toxicity profiles. This review discusses with an emphasis on the clinical trials using green tea extract (GTE) in chemoprevention of oral premalignant lesions along with use of GTE as a chemopreventive agent in various other cancers as well. It is worthwhile to include green tea extract in an oral screening program for evaluating the premalignant lesions comparing the results between the treated and untreated group. Given the wide acceptance of green tea, its benefits may help in effective chemoprevention oral cancer."]

ABSTRACT ["To investigate the association between tea consumption and lung cancer.", "A case-control study was conducted, including 1225 newly diagnosed cases with lung cancer and 1234 healthy control subjects frequently matched by gender and age (+/- 3 year). Epidemiological data were collected by in-person interviews using a standard questionnaire. The adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by fitting multivariate unconditional logistic regression models that included potential confounding factors.", "A protective effect of tea drinking on risk of lung cancer was observed for non-smokers with adjusted OR was 0.465 (95% 0.345 - 0.625), and the risks decreased with increased years of tea drinking. The adjusted ORs for drinking green tea, black tea, oolong tea and others was 0.333 (95% CI 0.154 -0.720), 0.522 (95% CI 0.356 - 0.767), 0.735 (95% CI 0.424 - 1.274) and 0.267 (95% CI 0.143 - 0.497), respectively. The inverse associations were also observed between frequency, concentration, consumption and risk of lung cancer among non-smokers. Tea drinking was associated with decreased risk of lung cancer for those smokers with drinking tea < 3 times/week and low concentration, with the adjusted ORs of 0.453 (95% CI 0.286 - 0.717) and 0.518 (95% CI 0.346 - 0.778), respectively.", "The protective effect of tea drinking was observed on the risk of lung cancer, especially for non-smokers."]

91) Differential prooxidative effects of the green tea polyphenol, (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate, in normal and oral cancer cells are related to differences in sirtuin 3 signaling.
ABSTRACT ["We have previously reported that the green tea catechin, (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), can induce oxidative stress in oral cancer cells but exerts antioxidant effects in normal cells. Here, we report that these differential prooxidative effects are associated with sirtuin 3 (SIRT3), an important mitochondrial redox modulator.", "EGCG rapidly induced mitochondria-localized reactive oxygen species in human oral squamous carcinoma cells (SCC-25, SCC-9) and premalignant leukoplakia cells (MSK-Leuk1), but not in normal human gingival fibroblast cells (HGF-1). EGCG suppressed SIRT3 mRNA and protein expression, as well as, SIRT3 activity in SCC-25 cells, whereas it increased SIRT3 activity in HGF-1 cells. EGCG selectively decreased the nuclear localization of the estrogen-related receptor \u03b1 (ERR\u03b1), the transcription factor regulating SIRT3 expression, in SCC-25 cells. This indicates that EGCG may regulate SIRT3 transcription in oral cancer cells via ERR\u03b1. EGCG also differentially modulated the mRNA expressions of SIRT3-associated downstream targets including glutathione peroxidase 1 and superoxide dismutase 2 in normal and oral cancer cells.", "SIRT3 represents a novel potential target through which EGCG exerts differential prooxidant effects in cancer and normal cells. Our results provide new biomarkers to be further explored in animal studies."]

92) The association of tea consumption with bladder cancer risk: a meta-analysis.
ABSTRACT ["The association between tea consumption and bladder cancer has been confirmed in several animal studies, but one epidemiological study in 2001 showed no association between them. In order to provide an accurate assessment of this, we conducted a meta-analysis on tea consumption and bladder cancer risk. Studies were identified by a literature search in PubMed from January 1980 to March 2012 and the reference lists of relevant studies. Random effect models were used to calculate summary relative risk estimates (RR) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on high contrast to low intake values. Twenty-four publications (6 cohort studies and 18 case-control studies) based on consumption of overall tea, black tea, and green tea to bladder cancer risk were included in this analysis. For overall tea, the summary RR indicated no association between tea consumption and bladder cancer (RR= 1.09, 95%CI: 0.85-1.40). In subgroup analyses, we found a moderate increase of bladder cancer risk in smoking group (RR= 1.77, 95%CI: 1.04-3.01). In the black tea group, no statistically significant association was observed (RR= 0.84, 95%CI: 0.70-1.01). Interestingly, in the subgroup of sex, a protective effect was observed between tea consumption and bladder cancer risk in female (RR= 0.61, 95%CI: 0.38- 0.98). For green tea group, there was no relationship associated with bladder cancer risk (RR= 1.03, 95%CI: 0.82- 1.31). In conclusion, our data suggest that high overall tea intake in smokers increased the risk of bladder cancer, and high black tea intake in female may reduce the risk of bladder cancer."]

ABSTRACT ["Radiation-induced discomfort is frequently observed during pelvic radiotherapy. This study was performed to determine the effect of a green tea tablet to reduce the incidence of radiation-induced diarrhea and vomiting in patients with abdomen and pelvic malignancy.", "This randomized controlled clinical trial recruited 42 patients with abdomen and pelvic malignancy considered for treatment with 50 Gy radiotherapy, randomly assigned to the green tea tablet 450 mg (n = 21) or placebo group (n = 21) for 5 weeks. Acute gastrointesinal complications (Diarrhea and vomiting) were weekly assessed using Common Toxicity Criteria of the National Cancer Institute version 3.0 and functional living index emesis, respectively. Two-sample t-tests, Pearson's Chi-square, Mann-Whitney U-test, and Friedman were used for analysis.", "There was a significant difference in frequency of reported diarrhea between two groups of study at the end of study (P < 0.002). About 81% of patients in green tea group reported no history of diarrhea at week 5. The treatment group have reported no history of severe diarrhea during radiotherapy. There was no significant difference between two groups of study in frequency of vomiting throughout the study, but 9.5% of cases in placebo group showed severe vomiting.", "Green tea contains a high concentration of catechins could be effective in decreasing the frequency and severity of radiotherapy induced diarrhea. Green tea (450 mg/day) could be considered to be a safe for prevention diarrhea and vomiting in patients undergoing pelvic or abdomen radiotherapy."]

94) Epigallocathechin gallate, polyphenol present in green tea, inhibits stem-like characteristics and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in nasopharyngeal cancer cell lines.
ABSTRACT ["Previous studies have demonstrated that the consumption of green tea inhibits the growth of various cancers. Most cancers are believed to be initiated from and maintained by a small population of cancer stem-like cells (CSC) or tumor-initiating cells (TIC) that are responsible for tumor relapse and chemotherapeutic resistance. Although epigallocathechin gallate (EGCG), the most abundant catechin in green tea, has been reported to induce growth inhibition and apoptosis in some cancer cells, its effect on CSC is undefined. In this study, we enriched CSC by the sphere formation, and provided an efficient model for further experiments. Using this method, we examined the effects of EGCG regulating the nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) CSC and attempted to elucidate the possible mechanisms.", "NPC TW01 and TW06 cell lines were enriched by sphere formation and characterized their phenotypical properties, such as invasion capacity, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and gene expression were analyzed by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (q-RT-PCR). EGCG-induced growth inhibition in the parental and sphere-derived cells was determined by MTT and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) assay. EGCG-induced apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry with Annexin V and PI staining. The effects of EGCG on sphere-derived cell tumorigenicity, migration and invasion were determined by soft agar assay, wound healing, and cell invasion assay. The alternation of protein expression regulated by EGCG on these sphere-derived cells was assessed by immunofluorescence staining and western blot.", "NPC sphere-derived cells grown in serum-free non-adherent culture showed increased expression of stem cell markers and EMT markers compared to parental cells grown in conventional culture. Although EGCG induced growth inhibition and apoptosis in the parental cells in a dose-dependent manner, it was not as effective against spheres. However, EGCG potently inhibited sphere formation and can eliminate the stem cell characteristics of NPC and inhibit the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) signatures.", "Overall, these findings show that NPC cells with sphere formations possess the properties of CSC. Using this model, we found that EGCG regulated NPC CSC, their self-renewal capacity, and inhibited their invasive characteristics. It supports the pivotal role of EGCG as a dietary compound targeting NPC and may decrease recurrence and metastasis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells."]

95) Drug-delivery systems of green tea catechins for improved stability and bioavailability.
ABSTRACT ["Numerous studies in humans, animal models and cell lines have suggested the potential benefits from the consumption of green tea polyphenols, including prevention of cancer and heart diseases. However these potential effects have been strongly limited by green tea catechins low bioavailability, which hinders the development of therapeutic applications. In this review formulations that are being proposed for delivery of green tea catechins are discussed. New delivery systems are presented as valid alternatives to overcome the limitations such as green tea catechins poor stability or intestinal absorption."]

96) The role of antioxidant versus pro-oxidant effects of green tea polyphenols in cancer prevention.
ABSTRACT ["Consumption of green tea (Camellia sinensis) may provide protection against chronic diseases, including cancer. Green tea polyphenols are believed to be responsible for this cancer preventive effect, and the antioxidant activity of the green tea polyphenols has been implicated as a potential mechanism. This hypothesis has been difficult to study in vivo due to metabolism of these compounds and poor understanding of the redox environment in vivo. Green tea polyphenols can be direct antioxidants by scavenging reactive oxygen species or chelating transition metals as has been demonstrated in vitro. Alternatively, they may act indirectly by upregulating phase II antioxidant enzymes. Evidence of this latter effect has been observed in vivo, yet more work is required to determine under which conditions these mechanisms occur. Green tea polyphenols can also be potent pro-oxidants, both in vitro and in vivo, leading to the formation of hydrogen peroxide, the hydroxyl radical, and superoxide anion. The potential role of these pro-oxidant effects in the cancer preventive activity of green tea is not well understood. The evidence for not only the antioxidant, but also pro-oxidant, properties of green tea is discussed in the present review."]

97) [Green tea and its role on chemoprevention in vivo of genotoxic damage induced by carcinogenic metals (chromium [VI])].
ABSTRACT ["Consumption of green tea, by its antioxidant properties, has been associated with beneficial health effects, because antioxidant may play a role in the risk and pathogenesis of several chronic diseases, especially cardiovascular disease and cancer. On the other hand, it has been reported that metal compounds such as chromium [VI] are carcinogenic and can induce genotoxic damage through the Oxidative Stress. Therefore, it is possible that green tea has a protective effect against the genotoxic damage induced by this compounds.", "To evaluate the effect of oral administration of green tea over the genotoxic damage induced by Cr [VI] by quantification of micronucleus (MN) in polychromatic erythrocytes (EPC).", "We use mice of CD-1 strain that were randomly divided into the following groups: (i) control, (ii) treatment with green tea, (iii) treatment with chromium trioxide, (iv) treatment with green tea and chromium trioxide. The green tea was administrated via intragastric tube every 12 hours over two days (4 doses of 0.25 ml infusions 1.6 g/7.5 ml) and ad libitum (5.6 ml/day for 10 days infusions of 3.2 g/100 ml), while chromium trioxide was administrated via intraperitoneal (20 mg/kg). Blood samples were obtained from the caudal vein, the number of MN in EPC was assessed at 0, 24, 48 and 72 hours after the treatments.", "The group treated with green tea showed no significant statistical changes in the average of MN. On the other hand, the group that was dosed with the chromium trioxide showed an increase between 4 and 8 MN, which was statistically significant when compared with control group, which confirmed the genotoxic damage. When the green tea treatment was administered before the application of chromium trioxide, there was a decrease in MN frequencies of 31 and 62% at 72 hours, 20 and 35% at 48 hours and 18 and 31% at 24 hours with intragastric and ad libitum respectively, compared with the group treated only with chromium trioxide. Hence, green tea reduced the genotoxic damage induced by chromium trioxide, and the highest protection was presented at 72 hours.", "Our findings support the protective effects of green tea against the damage of genetic material, induced by metal compounds such as chromium [VI], suggesting that its antioxidant compounds are those that have a chemopreventive effect on the EOX generated by the Cr [VI] during its reduction to Cr (III). The fact that the largest decrease in the frequency of MN was observed at 72 hours and ad libitum treatment, suggests that, the protective effect depends on the bioavailability, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of the active ingredient in green tea, so the administration of green tea for a long period of time before the exposure to Cr [VI] could have a more consistent preventive effect."]

ABSTRACT ["To ascertain the relationship between tea drinking and the risk of ovarian cancer among southern Chinese women, a case-control study was conducted in southern China during 2006-2008.", "Five hundred incident patients with histologically confirmed epithelial carcinoma of the ovary and 500 controls (mean age 59 years) were recruited from four public hospitals in Guangzhou. Information on frequency, quantity and duration of tea drinking, amount of dried tea leaves brewed, together with habitual diet and lifestyle characteristics, was obtained face-to-face from participants using a validated and reliable questionnaire. Logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the association between tea consumption variables and the ovarian cancer risk.", "The control subjects reported higher tea consumption levels and prevalence (78.8%) than the ovarian cancer patients (51.4%). Regular drinking of green tea, black tea and/or oolong tea was associated with a lower risk of ovarian cancer, the adjusted odds ratio being 0.29 (95% confidence interval 0.22-0.39) after accounting for confounding factors.

99) Increased chemopreventive effect by combining arctigenin, green tea polyphenol and curcumin in prostate and breast cancer cells.
ABSTRACT ["The low bioavailability of most flavonoids limits their application as anti-carcinogenic agents in humans. A novel approach of treatment with a mixture of bioactive compounds that share molecular anti-carcinogenic targets may enhance the effect on these targets at low concentrations of individual compound, thereby overcoming the limitations of reduced bioavailability. We therefore investigated whether a combination of three natural products arctigenin (Arc), a novel anti-inflammatory lignan from the seeds of Arctium lappa, green tea polyphenol (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and curcumin (Cur) increases the chemopreventive potency of individual compounds. LNCaP prostate cancer and MCF-7 breast cancer cells were treated with 2-4 mg/L (about 5-10\u03bcM) Cur, 1\u03bcM Arc and 40\u03bcM EGCG alone or in combination for 48h. In both cell lines treatment with the mixture of Cur, Arc and EGCG synergistically increased the antiproliferative effect. In LNCaP cells both Arc and EGCG increased the pro-apoptotic effect of Cur. Whereas in MCF-7 cells Arc increased the cell apoptosis of Cur while EGCG enhanced cell cycle arrest of Cur at G0/G1 phase. The strongest effects on cell cycle arrest and apoptosis were achieved by combining all three compounds in both cell lines. The combination treatment significantly increased the ratio of Bax to Bcl-2 proteins, decreased the activation of NF\u03baB, PI3K/Akt and Stat3 pathways and cell migration compared to individual treatment. These results warrant in vivo studies to confirm the efficacy of this novel regimen by combining Arc and EGCG with Cur to enhance chemoprevention in both prostate and breast cancer."]
