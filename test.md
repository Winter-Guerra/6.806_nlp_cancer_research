Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by a lack in estrogen,
progesterone, and epidermal growth factor 2 receptors. TNBC exhibits most of
the characteristics of basal-like and claudin-low breast cancer subtypes. The
main contributor in the mortality of TNBC is due to the higher invasive and
migratory ability of these tumor cells. Some plant flavonoids inhibit the
epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) of tumor cells and suppress cancer
metastasis. In this study, we aimed to determine whether the flavonoid
quercetin is effective in modulating the molecular signaling associated with
EMT in TNBC. Our data indicated that quercetin can induce the expression of
E-cadherin and also downregulate vimentin levels in TNBC. The ability of
quercetin to modulate these EMT markers resulted in a mesenchymal-to-
epithelial transition (MET). Quercetin-induced MET was linked with the
alteration of nuclear localization of β-catenin and modulation of β-catenin
target genes such as cyclin D1 and c-Myc. Furthermore, we observed that
quercetin induced the anti-tumor activity of doxorubicin by inhibiting the
migratory ability of TNBC cells. These results suggested that quercetin may
inhibit TNBC metastasis and also improve the therapeutic efficacy of existing
chemotherapeutic drugs. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) comprises approximately 10-30% of all
breast cancers. It is characterized by the absence of estrogen, progesterone,
and epidermal growth factor 2 receptors (EGFR2). Since these three receptors
are the drug targets to treat breast cancer [1-3], current successful
therapies such as hormone and antibody therapies are not effective to this
patient population. Furthermore, "targeted therapy" for TNBC treatment has not
yet been established due to the absence of identification of pathway specific
targets [1, 2]. Current chemotherapy options are beneficial to the TNBC
patient population and the response to chemotherapy is higher in compared to
other breast cancer subtypes [4, 5]. However, the relapse rates are higher in
first three years after treatment and chemotherapy resistance tend to develop,
which causes reduction in the chemotherapy potential for TNBC treatment. The
metastatic form of TNBC is very aggressive and treatment options are limited.

Better treatment options are needed that are less toxic, reduce the risk of
disease progression, and are more targeted to this patient population. This is
possible by identification of new targets or by detection of new novel
molecules, which will inhibit the tumor proliferation and migration and
diminish the drug resistance. Different promising areas of research are
currently underway for the identification of newer biologic and targeted
therapies for TNBC population, such as development of poly ADP ribose
polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, EGFR inhibitors, and therapies that target
cancer stem cells [6, 7].

Scientific research has focused recently on the anti-carcinogenic effect of
different flavonoids [8-16]. Flavonoids are polyphenolic compounds in
vegetables and fruits that can protect against the development and progression
of breast cancer [8-10]. In particular, quercetin has been found to have anti-
oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties [11-13]. Quercetin is present in
various fruits, vegetables, seeds, nuts, green tea, and red wine [14]. Studies
have documented the anti-cancer activity of quercetin in various cancer cells
[11-16]. Studies suggested that the biological activity of quercetin is
exhibited by acting on multi targets. This anti-cancer activity has been
attributed to different mechanisms, such as anti-oxidant activity, inhibition
of enzymes that activate oncogenes, modification of signal transduction
pathways, and interaction with different proteins enzymes and receptors
[11-13]. Studies have also suggested that quercetin protects the toxic effect
of doxorubicin or cisplatin-induced damages in cancer cell [17]. The mechanism
of action of anti-carcinogenic activity of quercetin in TNBC is not yet
elucidated. Most of the earlier studies elucidated the anti-proliferative
effect of quercetin in various cancer cells [11-16]. However, few studies have
pointed towards the anti-invasive efficacy of flavonoid quercetin in cancer
cells [18, 19]. Flavonoids inhibit cancer metastasis by suppressing of matrix
metalloproteinase (MMP) secretion and reducing the angiogenesis [18]. A recent
study suggested that addition of luteolin and quercetin in a human epidermal
cancer cell line (A431-III) resulted in the inhibition of invadopodia
formation and decrement of extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation [19]. But
detailed studies have not yet been carried out to reveal how quercetin might
inhibit invasive breast cancer cells.

Research has established that epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a
crucial mechanism for gaining the invasive and migratory ability of cancer
cells. This phenomenon can be reversed by modulating the molecular signals
involved in the formation of EMT [20, 21]. This reversal is called mesenchymal
to epithelial transition (MET). Various signaling molecules are involved in
the transition between epithelial to mesenchymal phenotype. E-cadherin is one
of the major signaling molecules that contribute to the maintenance of cell-
cell adhesion. Cancer cells with less E-cadherin expression losses the
adhesion properties of tumor that allows it to invade to near surrounding
areas. β-catenin is another important structural component of the adhesion
complex. E-cadherin/β-catenin binding is essential for the cells to adhere one
another [22]. Most invasive breast carcinoma display lower expression levels
of E-cadherin [23] and the phosphorylated active form of β-catenin in the
nucleus [24]; this indicates that dissociation of E-cadherin/β-catenin complex
may be a way to thwart TNBC. Researchers have identified different genes as
downstream effectors of β-catenin, and of these, c-Myc and cyclin D1 are the
main target genes. Myc is highly expressed in TNBC subtype, which influences
the tumor growth, metastasis, and chemotherapy resistance [25]. Similarly
cyclin D1 is highly expressed in various cancers, and higher levels of this
gene are associated with poor prognosis of breast cancer [26]. Therefore, we
were interested to learn about the effects of flavonoids on EMT process,
β-catenin signaling and its target genes in TNBC.

Our present study describes the possible utilization of flavonoid compound
against the higher EMT process that occurs in TNBC cells. We wanted to find
out if exposure to quercetin resulted in higher expression levels of
E-cadherin, which might lead to the decreased EMT process. Decreased nuclear
localization of β-catenin by quercetin would further explain the action of
quercetin in regulating the action of β-catenin in TNBC. We also wanted to
find out if quercetin is able to decrease the expression levels of β-catenin
target genes, such as cyclin D1 and c-Myc.

#### Cell Culture and Reagents

TNBC cells, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468, were purchased from ATCC. TNBC cells
were grown in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) and supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin at 37°C in 5% CO2.
Quercetin and 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
(MTT) were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO).

#### Cell Viability Assay

MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells were harvested during the logarithmic growth
phase. To study the effects of quercetin on cell proliferation and viability,
MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells (5×103/well) were plated in 96-well plates for
24 h. Cells were washed once with medium and treated with different
concentration of quercetin (0-100 μM) for 72 h. Then the cells were treated
with 10 µl MTT (5 mg/mL) for 4 h. Subsequently, solubilization reagent was
added and incubated the solution overnight to completely dissolve the purple
precipitate obtained from MTT. Microplate reader was used to test the
absorbance (A) of each well at 570 nm and average values were obtained.

#### Proliferation Assay

Actively growing MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 TNBC cell lines were seeded at a
density of 2.5 × 104 cells in cell culture dishes and 24 h later, the cells
were exposed to vehicle or different concentrations of quercetin. Cell
proliferation was assessed every 24 h by counting viable cells using
haemocytometer with Trypan blue staining. The cell counts were recorded and
presented as a quantitative graphic representation.

#### Wound Healing Assay

MDA-MB-468 cells were cultured to approximately 90% confluent, a small pipette
tip was used to make a scratch in the monolayer of vehicle or quercetin
treated cells. Cell migration was captured using bright field microscope and
quantified by measuring the unclosed area in the middle of the scratch after
the cells migrates towards the center from both sides. Wound repair was
calculated over control.

#### Migration and Invasion Assays

Quercetin treated (24 h) MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells (2.5×103) were seeded
in Boyden chambers containing matrigel or no matrigel (BioCoat, Franklin
Lakes, NJ). Complete growth medium was added to the wells as the chemo-
attractant. Boyden chambers were placed in wells containing complete medium.
The migrated/invaded cells on the lower surface of the membrane were counter
stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO).
Cells were scored with a fluorescent microscope and the images were taken at
20x magnification. Cell migration/invasion was calculated over control. Boyden
chambers with matrigel were used for invasion and no matrigel were used for
cell migration assays.

#### Immunofluorescence Analysis

Quercetin or vehicle treated cells were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS
for 15 min, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X100 for 5 min. Cells
were blocked for 1 h using 5% goat serum contain 3% BSA. Then, cells were
incubated with the primary antibodies for 1 h followed by incubation with the
fluorochrome-labeled secondary antibody for 30 min at room temperature. Nuclei
were stained with 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Sigma-Aldrich) for 10
min. Membrane staining was carried out using wheat germ agglutinin. Slides
were mounted with Fluoromount G (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL) mounting
medium and images were captured using Leica DMI 6000B fluorescence microscope.

#### Western Blot Analysis

Quercetin or vehicle treated cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (Peirce,
Rockford, IL) containing protease inhibitor cocktail for mammalian cells
(Peirce). Lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min and the protein
concentration of supernatant (For E-cadherin and vimentin) was determined
using the BCA assay kit (Pierce). For β-catenin experiment, cytosolic and
nuclear fraction was prepared using Epiquick nuclear extraction kit
(Epigentek, Farmingdale, NY). Equal amounts of protein were resolved by SDS-
PAGE (BIO-RAD). Proteins were transferred nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore)
by semi-dry transfer, blocked with 5% skim milk powder in PBS/0.1% Tween 20
and incubated overnight at 4°C with different diluted (1:1000) primary
antibodies. Membranes were washed three times with PBST and then incubated
with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:10,000) for 1 h at room
temperature. Visualization was performed by use of Amersham ECL plus Western
blotting detection system (GE healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK).
Chemiluminescence images were analyzed and densitometric measurements were
carried out using the Image-J software (NIH).

#### Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) Analysis

Total RNA was isolated using Qiagen RNAeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Equal
amount of RNA from quercetin or vehicle treated cells were reverse transcribed
using Verzo cDNA kit (Thermoscientific, Waltham, MA). qRT-PCR was carried out
using Taqman gene expression assay of E-cadherin, c-Myc and cyclin D1 (Life
technologies, Waltham, MA).

#### Statistical Analyses

Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism (version 6.0)
software (GraphPadPrism Software, Inc.). All the data were analyzed for
statistical significance using Student's _t_-test/ one-way ANOVA. For all
experiments, _P_ < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

#### Quercetin Decreased the Growth and Cell Survival of TNBC Cells

A considerable attention has been recently made to identify the anti-
carcinogenic effect of different flavonoids [8-16]. However the mechanism of
action of anti-carcinogenic activity of quercetin in TNBC is not yet
elucidated. We used two TNBC cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468, for our
studies. Initially, we investigated whether exposing these two cell lines to
different concentrations of quercetin (0.01-100 μM) affected anti-
proliferation activity. Quercetin significantly decreased the survival of MDA-
MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells in a dose dependent manner (Figure 1A). Further to
study whether the decreased cell survival may be due to the decreased
proliferation, cell growth analysis was carried out to assess the quercetin-
dependent cell proliferation in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells in a time and
dose dependent manner. The results obtained from the efficacy of quercetin on
cell proliferation assay were consistent with its effect on cell survival
data. Quercetin significantly inhibited the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 and
MDA-MB-468 cells to a greater extent compared to vehicle treated control cells
in different periods of the experiment (Figure 1B).

#### Quercetin Induced Change in Cell Morphology and Inhibited Cell Migration
of TNBC Cells

Metastatic process of breast cancer is associated with rearrangement of
cytoskeletal proteins and that result in cell morphology changes [27]. MDA-
MB-468 cells are highly aggressive TNBC cells, and were used to analyze the
efficacy of quercetin on the alteration of cellular morphology. Quercetin
treatment changed the fibroblast spindle-like shape of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-
MB-468 cells to cobblestone epithelial phenotype (Figure 2A). This change in
morphology was initiated by treating the cells with 10 μM quercetin for 24 h.
This observation was very evident with 50 μM quercetin treatment in both MDA-
MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells. The morphological changes induced by quercetin
were also observed when cells were cultured in higher density, indicating that
change in cell shape in quercetin treated samples is not due to the cytotoxic
effect of quercetin.

The metastatic potential of breast cancer cells can be assessed by measuring
cell motility [28]. The wound healing assay was used to measure the efficacy
of quercetin on the motility of MDA-MB-468 cells. A wound was created by
scratching confluent monolayers of MDA-MB-468 cells treated with quercetin (10
or 50 μM) or vehicle. Control cells repaired the wound within 24 h of culture,
whereas quercetin treatment significantly (_P_ < 0.01) reduced the wound
healing cell compared to vehicle (Figure 2B). This experiment established that
quercetin could interfere with the cell motility of TNBC.

To confirm this observation, we further carried out the invasion studies
through the basement membrane. The invasive potential of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-
MB-468 cells treated with quercetin was analyzed in a Boyden chamber coated
with extracellular matrix (matrigel) and using 10% FBS as a chemoattractant.
MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells treated with quercetin for 24 h exhibited a
significant (threefold, _P_ < 0.01) decrease in the migration ability relative
to vehicle-treated cells (Figure 2C). These results confirmed that the
quercetin has a significant effect in inhibiting invasive ability of TNBC
cells. Further, to examine the mechanism underlying the cell invasion and
altering the mesenchymal morphology of TNBC, we analyzed the impact of
quercetin on different signaling molecules in TNBC cells.

#### Quercetin Altered the Vimentin and E-Cadherin Expression Levels

The above data suggested that quercetin is able to alter the spindle-shaped
mesenchymal morphology of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells to epithelial
phenotype. Vimentin is generally used as an EMT marker, and during MET,
vimentin protein and mRNA expression is downregulated [29]. Experiments were
carried out to analyze whether quercetin is able to down regulate the vimentin
expression level in MDA-MB-231 cells. As expected, Western blot analysis
revealed a significant decrease in the vimentin protein expression level
(Figure 3A). Immunofluorescence analysis was also carried out to measure the
vimentin expression level and the proper visualization of mesenchymal
transition to epithelial morphology. The lesser fluorescence in the quercetin
treated sample indicated that the expression level of vimentin is
significantly lower compared to the control (Figure 3B). The transition of
spindle shaped mesenchymal phenotype to cobblestone epithelial cell morphology
by quercetin treatment was very evident from immunofluorescence analysis.

ref=image_n/mc22318-fig-0003.png)

Loss of expression of epithelial adherence junction protein is a biochemical
hallmark of mesenchymal transition [30]. Loss of E-cadherin in combination
with the appearance of spindle cell morphology is associated with EMT in
breast cancer cells. Expression level of E-cadherin is very low in MDA-MB-231
cells compared to the primary breast cancer model (MCF-7) [31]. Here, we
investigated whether the quercetin-induced epithelial transition of MDA-MB-231
cells were associated with alteration of E-cadherin expression level. Our
results showed that quercetin (50 μM) significantly increased the E-cadherin
expression compared to vehicle treated cells, nine fold increase in mRNA
expression (_P_ < 0.001) and 10-fold higher protein expression was observed by
qRT-PCR (Figure 3C) and Western blot analysis (Figure 3A), respectively. These
results confirmed that quercetin has a significant impact on vimentin and
E-cadherin levels.

#### Quercetin Treatment Inactivated β-Catenin

From the above data, it is clear that quercetin has significant effect in
regulating the migratory ability of TNBC. It is essential to identify various
signaling molecules that are regulated by quercetin and that contribute to the
transition of the mesenchymal phenotype to the epithelial shape. It has been
established that wnt/β-catenin pathway activation triggers EMT and leads to
cancer cell invasion [6]. Of the many signaling molecules associated with the
wnt/β-catenin pathway, β-catenin is the downstream transcriptional activator
responsible for transmitting the cytoplasmic cellular signals into the
nucleus, which leads to the activation of various target genes [32, 33].
Therefore we examined the expression and subcellular localization of β-catenin
in quercetin treated MDA-MB-231 cells.

Our immunofluorescence analysis of MDA-MB-231 cells showed the nuclear
localization of β-catenin in vehicle treated cells, whereas the major
β-catenin localization was observed in the cytoplasm of quercetin treated
cells (Figure 4A). Result observed with MDA-MB-231 was further confirmed by
Western blot analysis using nuclear and cytoplasmic cellular fractions.
Quercetin-treated MDA-MB-231 cells exhibited higher cytoplasmic β-catenin
expression level, whereas the nuclear fraction of vehicle treated cells showed
higher β-catenin expression level (Figure 4B). These results indicated that
the quercetin degraded the nuclear β-catenin and led to the inactivation of
β-catenin downstream signaling.

#### Alteration of β-Catenin Target Genes

The above data suggested that quercetin diminishes the activity of β-catenin
in MDA-MB-231 cells. β-catenin is involved in the transcriptional activation
of different target genes such as cyclin D1, c-Myc, and metalloproteinase-2 by
releasing the inhibition of TCF/lymphoid enhancer factor [34, 35]. We
determined the effect of quercetin treatment on expression levels of cyclin D1
and c-Myc in MDA-MB-231 cells. Results showed that 24 h treatment of quercetin
significantly decreased the mRNA and protein expression level of cyclin D1 (_P
_< 0.05) and c-Myc (_P _< 0.01) by qRT-PCR analysis (Figure 5A). It has been
reported that cyclin D1 is localized predominantly in the nucleus of growing
cells [36, 37] and is associated with chemotherapy resistance and cancer cell
migration in various cancers including ovarian cancer [38-40]. Studies
suggested that GSK3-β plays a significant role in the degradation rate of
cyclin D1 [41].

ref=image_n/mc22318-fig-0005.png)

Studies have established that Akt is the major signaling molecule regulating
the activity of GSK3-β [42]. Therefore, we carried out experiments to study
the effect of quercetin on Akt phosphorylation of MDA-MB-231 cells. Western
blot analysis showed that quercetin (10 and 50 μM) significantly decreased the
phosphorylation of Akt in the above-mentioned TNBC cells. MDA-MB-231 cells
exhibit approximately threefold reduction in Akt phosphorylation (Ser473)
followed by 6 h of quercetin (50 μM) treatment (Figure 5B).

Recent reports have suggested that PI3K/Akt mediated cell motility enhances
the progression of cancer metastasis, also the cross talk between PI3K/Akt and
TGF-β/Smad pathway stimulate cell migration [43] and enhance cancer cell
metastasis [44]. Our studies revealed that quercetin regulated the Akt
signaling in TNBC cells and led to the regulation of different downstream
signaling pathway such as cyclin D1 and β-catenin.

#### Quercetin Decreased the Motility Induced by Doxorubicin in TNBC Cells

Previous studies suggested that in other cancer cells, quercetin potentiates
doxorubicin mediated anti-tumor effects [16]. To test whether quercetin
enhances the anti-carcinogenic effect of doxorubicin, we carried out a Boyden
chamber migration assay in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells treated with
different concentrations (0.1 or 0.5 μM) of doxorubicin. Our studies revealed
that 0.1 μM doxorubicin significantly (_P _< 0.01) decreased the migration of
both TNBC cell lines; however the migratory ability was not decreased with 0.5
μM concentration (Figure 6A). A similar observation was also reported by other
investigators regarding doxorubicin and other chemotherapy drugs [45].
Further, migration studies were assessed to analyze the ability of quercetin
to decrease the invasion in cells treated with doxorubicin. Quercetin
significantly decreased the migration in cells treated with both MDA-MB-231
and MDA-MB-468 (Figure 6A).

ref=image_n/mc22318-fig-0006.png)

Available reports have suggested that alteration of TGF-β signaling is one of
the major causative factors that block the effect of chemotherapy on breast
cancer migration [45, 46]. To test whether doxorubicin altered TGF-β
signaling, we treated MDA-MB-231 cells with different concentrations of
doxorubicin and analyzed the expression level of TGF-β1 by qRT-PCR analysis.
Studies revealed that lower concentration of doxorubicin (10 nM) significantly
(_P _< 0.01) reduced TGF-β1 level, whereas 0.5 μM concentration of doxorubicin
significantly enhanced the TGF-β1 mRNA expression (Figure 6B).

Further, we carried out combination treatment of doxorubicin and quercetin in
MDA-MB-231 in order to analyze the effect of quercetin to inhibit this TGF-β1
signaling as well as the migratory potential of doxorubicin. Quercetin
decreased the TGF-β1 signaling (Figure 6C) and also enhanced the ability of
doxorubicin to decrease the migratory potential of TNBC. These results
suggested that quercetin is able to decrease the TGF-β1 signaling in
doxorubicin-treated TNBC and may contribute to decreased cell migration.

#### Oncoprint Analysis of Genes Altered in Breast Cancer Basal-Like and
Claudin-Low Sub Types

TNBC has most of the characteristics of basal-like and claudin-low sub types
(1-5), therefore genomic alterations in basal-like and claudin-low subtypes of
breast cancer were analyzed using cBioportal of cancer genomics [47, 48].
Analysis was focused on E-cadherin, cyclin D1, c-Myc, β-catenin and vimentin,
which are significantly regulated in our experiments by quercetin treatment
(Figure 7A and B). E-cadherin, an EMT marker is down regulated (25%) in
claudin-low subtypes while 5% alteration in basal-like subtypes. Another EMT
marker vimentin is upregulated in both basal-like and claudin-low patient
samples. Upregulation of β-catenin mRNA was observed in basal-like subtype.
Notably, 35% alteration including gene amplification and mRNA upregulation was
observed for c-Myc in basal-like subtypes while there was no alteration in
claudin-low subtypes. These observations indicate that the quercetin altered
genes such as E-cadherin, cyclin D1, c-Myc, β-catenin and vimentin have
significant implication in basal-like and claudin-low patients and
modification of these genes may have beneficial effect to diminish TNBC
metastasis.

In the present study, we revealed the effect of a flavonoid on the migratory
ability of TNBC cells. Previous studies suggested that quercetin, one of the
major flavonoids present in fruits and vegetables, exerts its anti-tumor
effect by decreasing the proliferative and migratory potential of TNBC cells.
However, approximately 20% of TNBCs lack basal-like markers such as
cytokeratin (CK) 5/6, CK 14, CK 17, and EGFR [1, 49]. Targeted therapy for
metastatic breast cancer has been not sensitive to TNBC due to the lack of
cell surface receptors. Further studies are warranted to identify new targets
and new therapies that inhibit the metastatic ability of TNBC.

EMT happens in normal developmental and physiological processes, such as
embryogenesis and wound healing respectively [50]. During this transformation,
cobblestone-shaped epithelial cells change morphology and lose the ability of
cell-cell attachment, resulting in the mesenchymal spindle-shaped cells [20].
Also, EMT allows the migration of cancer cells by unravelling the cancer cells
from primary tumor site [51]. Different molecular signaling processes are
associated with EMT transformation. Of these alterations, E-cadherin loss is
one of the most significant characteristics of EMT in breast cancer
metastasis. The oncoprint analysis also showed the down regulation of
E-cadherin in some of the basal-like and claudin-low sub types. Western blot
and qRT-PCR showed that quercetin significantly increased the E-cadherin
expression in TNBC cells. In most of the metastatic cancer cells, E-cadherin
loss is associated with higher expression of vimentin. Upregulation of
vimentin was observed in oncoprint analysis of patient samples and also in
MDA-MB-231 cells. Our studies suggested that the vimentin level is markedly
decreased by quercetin treatment. Immunofluorescence analysis of vimentin
further confirms the ability of quercetin to induce the epithelial transition
of TNBC cells. In agreement with these results, a recent report suggested that
flavonoids inhibit invadopodia formation in A431-III cells [19].

Various studies have demonstrated that the alteration in β-catenin pathway
influences the migration of breast cancer [32, 33]. Breast cancer sample
oncoprint analysis also indicates higher β-catenin expression level in basal-
like cancer subtypes. The abnormal accumulation and nuclear translocation of
β-catenin is associated with oncogenic activation [32]. The active form of
β-catenin can bind to TCF/lymphoid enhancer factor (LEF) and enhances the
target genes such as c-Myc, MMP-2, and cyclin D1 [34]. Also, oncoprint of
breast cancer patient samples revealed higher expression of c-Myc in basal-
like breast cancer subtypes, this subtype is most closely related to TNBC.
Immunohistochemical analysis of patient material suggested higher nuclear
expression levels of β-catenin in TNBC samples [52].

Also, the increased nuclear β-catenin level was associated with poor clinical
outcome of TNBC. In agreement with these reports, our immunofluorescence
analysis showed nuclear localization of β-catenin in MDA-MDB-231cells (Figure
4A and B). Quercetin treatment decreased the nuclear localization of β-catenin
and that resulted into the cytosolic localization of β-catenin. E-cadherin is
one of the molecules that play a critical role in stabilizing β-catenin, by
E-cadherin/β-catenin complex formation. This complex formation is essential
for cell-cell adhesion and for maintenance of the epithelial phenotype [22].
Loss of E-cadherin may be one of the reasons for the nuclear localization of
β-catenin in TNBC. Quercetin is able to modulate the expression level of
E-cadherin and this contributes to the decreased level of nuclear localization
of β-catenin. This alteration by quercetin may have resulted in decreased
activation of LEF/TCF transcription factors, leading to decreased activation
of genes such as cyclin D1 and c-Myc. Decreased expression of levels these
genes were confirmed in quercetin-treated TNBC cells. Furthermore, c-Myc was
found to be elevated in patient oncoprint analysis. Nuclear localized cyclin
D1 has been shown to enhance tumor formation [36]. Our results suggested that
regulating β-catenin pathway by quercetin inhibits the downstream oncogenic
signaling cascades in TNBC.

The nuclear translocation of cyclin D1 is due to the phosphorylation at Thr286
by GSK-3β, the cytosolic fraction of cyclin D1 that undergoes proteosomal
degradation by the ubiquitination pathway [53]. Cyclin D1 is regulated by
nuclear accumulation and stabilization through Akt phosphorylation-induced
inhibition of GSK-3β [41, 42]. Therefore, Akt plays a significant role in
cyclin D1 cellular localization status in TNBC. Our study revealed that
treatment of quercetin inhibited the phosphorylation status of Akt in MDA-MB-
231 cells. This result defines the variation in cellular localization of
cyclin D1 in quercetin-treated cells. Reduced cyclin D1 nuclear localization
may regulate EMT, because cyclin D1 is able to reduce cell attachment and
induce breast cancer cell migration [54]. Studies have also suggested that
cyclin D1 activity is essential for the self-renewal of mammary stem and
progenitor cells [55].

Various available reports are supportive regarding the role of c-Myc in the
regulation of metastatic phenotype. It is established that Myc is highly
expressed in basal-like tumors compared to luminal and Her2 overexpressing
tumors [56]. Myc regulates the invasion and migration of cells by
collaborating with other oncogenic pathways [25]. This study suggested that
Myc and cyclin D1, the two β-catenin target genes, are downregulated by
quercetin in TNBC. This downregulation may be one of the reasons for the
inhibition of cell migration.

Our findings indicated that quercetin inhibits EMT by regulating different
signaling molecules that are involved in the formation of mesenchymal
phenotype. Furthermore, to confirm quercetin-mediated inhibition of TNBC
motility, doxorubicin-treated cells are used as experimental model.
Doxorubicin is an anthracycline drug and is one of the major drugs used as a
chemotherapy drug to treat TNBC. However, some studies have suggested that
treatment with doxorubicin induces migration and invasion of breast cancer
[46]. We identified that lower concentrations of doxorubicin (0.1 μM) inhibit
the migration of MDA-MB-231 cells, whereas higher concentrations is not able
to inhibit migratory ability of TNBC cells.

Previous studies indicated that activation of TGF-β signaling is one of the
mechanisms behind the enhancement of migration by doxorubicin [46]. We
confirmed this finding and observed that cells treated with 0.5 μM doxorubicin
significantly enhanced the expression level of TGF-β1 levels. The co-treatment
with doxorubicin and quercetin decreased TGF-β1 activation and prevented the
migration of MDA-MB-231 cells. Studies also suggested that quercetin
potentiates the effect of doxorubicin in drug resistant MCF-7 breast cancer
cell line [57], liver cancer cells [58]. Recurrence of cancer after
chemotherapy or radiotherapy is very common in TNBC patients. In this context,
further studies are needed to confirm that the recurrence of TNBC after
chemotherapy could be avoided by combination treatment of doxorubicin and
quercetin in order to enhance the doxorubicin effect in TNBC. In conclusion
our studies suggest that the quercetin inhibits the increased migration
ability of TNBC. Quercetin is able to regulate EMT markers such as E-cadherin
and vimentin in aggressive TNBC cells. Furthermore, quercetin is effective in
regulating active β-catenin signaling. Also, the quercetin is capable of
inhibiting TGF-β1 induced by higher concentration of doxorubicin. Further
studies will be needed to learn more about whether the combination treatment
of quercetin and doxorubicin would be a beneficial treatment for TNBC. Studies
will also be planned to develop different quercetin analogues to enhance its
bioavailability and the biological activity of these derivatives will be
compared with parent molecule.

Anti-tumor activity of quercetin was recorded in various pre-clinical and
clinical trials. Studies identified that dietary supplementation of quercetin
decreased the growth of orthotopic pancreatic tumors in a nude mouse model
[59]. A quercetin analogue 3′,4′,5′-trimethoxyflavonol inhibited tumor
development in _ApcMin_ mice and human-derived HCT116 adenocarcinoma-bearing
nude mice [60]. A recent study on dose-dependent effects of quercetin on
tumorigenesis in a C3(1)/SV40 Tag transgenic breast cancer model reported
reduced tumor volume in moderate dose (0.2% diet) administered group compared
to high (2%) and low dose (0.02%) [61]. Few studies on quercetin were
prolonged up to human clinical trial level. A phase 1 clinical trial studied
the anti-proliferative and pharmacokinetics effects of quercetin in cancer
patients and observed the tyrosine kinase inhibition and anti-tumor activity
[62]. The toxicity studies from this trial also revealed that the higher dose
of quercetin induced nephrotoxicity [62]. Recent studies have identified that
quercetin increases the bioavailability and chemo preventive action of green
tea in prostate cancer pre-clinical models [63, 64]. Further, these studies
are extended to confirm quercetin's ability to enhance the uptake of green tea
in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. Another clinical trial is
currently evaluating the efficacy of genistein and quercetin in comparison
with a placebo on the rate of increase in the prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
(NCT01538316). Early observations from this study showed an inverse
relationship between genistein intake and PSA levels in patients with higher
PSA levels [65]. The available pre-clinical and clinical data suggest that the
moderate dose of quercetin is less toxic and effective as an anti-tumor agent.
Additionally, quercetin showed significant influence in inducing the
bioavailability of other dietary constituents in preclinical and clinical
studies. The future studies will be focused on anti-tumor activity of
quercetin with existing chemotherapeutic drugs in inhibiting the migratory
ability of TNBC in animal model.
